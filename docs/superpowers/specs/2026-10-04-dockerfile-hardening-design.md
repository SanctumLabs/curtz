# Production image, `app` compose stack and CI — design

Status: draft for review · Date: 2026-10-04 · Slice 2 of 5

## 1. Intent

The `Dockerfile` cannot build the app today and is not safe to ship. It pins Go 1.18.1 while `go.mod` needs 1.26, runs as
root, has no `HEALTHCHECK`, builds with `-mod=mod` (a build may change dependencies), and is fed by an empty `.dockerignore`,
so `.git`, `.env` and `.superpowers/` reach the builder stage. CI is out of date in the same way: `docker.yml` and `build_app.yml`
use v1/v2 actions and Go 1.18, and the workflows that run on `workflow_run` check out the default branch instead of the commit
that triggered them.

This slice produces a hardened, reproducible image of the API and the migrator, an `app` compose stack so the container runs on
the `curtz` network the way it will in production, repaired lint and scan targets, and modernized CI.

**Success criteria**

1. `docker build` produces an image that runs as uid 65532, has no shell, and carries the API, the migrator and the migrations.
2. `hadolint` is clean, and Trivy reports no fixable HIGH or CRITICAL finding in the image.
3. `make infra.app.up MODE=single|ha` starts Postgres, Redis and the app and reaches `ready`; the container is `healthy`
   and `GET /health/ready` is `ok`.
4. The container runs with a read-only root filesystem, all capabilities dropped and `no-new-privileges`.
5. `docker run --entrypoint /app/migrator` applies the migrations from the image (a second run is "no change").
6. The build context contains no `.env`, `.git` or test files.
7. Every workflow passes `actionlint`, and the Docker workflow scans before it publishes.
8. `.gitlab-ci.yml` and `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` run the same lint, tests, build and image checks as GitHub, and
   `scripts/mirror_ci_check.sh` fails when they drift from it.

## 2. Scope

Slice table (updated; slice 3 is merged into `feat/local-infra-stack`):

| # | Slice | State |
|---|-------|-------|
| 1 | Local infrastructure stack | merged into `feat/local-infra-stack` (PR SanctumLabs/curtz#342, open) |
| 3 | App connectivity (config, health, shutdown, migrator) | merged into `feat/local-infra-stack` |
| 2 | **This spec** — image, `app` stack, CI | |
| 4 | OpenTelemetry | next |
| 5 | Outbox relay and the Kafka client | after 4 |

**In scope:** `Dockerfile`, `.dockerignore`, `hadolint.yaml`, a `healthcheck` subcommand in `app/cmd/main.go`, `deploy/app/compose.yml`
and the root `docker-compose.yml` include, `scripts/infra.sh` and `scripts/infra_test.sh`, `.make/docker.mk`, `.env.example` (only
if a variable is added), every file under `.github/workflows/`, `.github/dependabot.yml`, docs (`docs/LocalInfrastructure.md`,
`docs/Deployment.md`, `README.md`) and one ADR.

**Out of scope:** changing the secret names `deploy.yml` publishes (see §11), `fly.toml`, image signing, Kubernetes manifests,
OpenTelemetry, the Kafka client, the shared workflows in `SanctumLabs/ci-workflows`, and the broken `-tags legacy` build.

**Starting point.** After the pull into `feat/local-infra-stack` (tip `5d91b87`) the module did not compile: `server.go` used
`strconv` without importing it. That one-line fix is the first commit on this branch (`009f832`). The same pull made
`Server.Serve` honor `SERVER_HOST`, which this spec relies on (§5).

## 3. Decisions

| # | Decision | Why |
|---|----------|-----|
| D1 | The final stage is distroless `static` `:nonroot`, pinned by digest, with no shell. Confirmed by the user. | Smallest attack surface: no shell, no package manager, uid 65532, CA certificates and tzdata included. |
| D2 | The image carries `/app/curtz`, `/app/migrator` and `/app/migrations`. The compose `migrate` job stays on the `migrate/migrate` image. Confirmed by the user. | One artifact can serve and migrate (ADR-0014), and `make infra.postgres.up` still needs no app build. |
| D3 | CI is modernized as part of this slice. Confirmed by the user. | CI cannot build the app today. It can only be linted locally (`actionlint`); the first real run is on GitHub. |
| D4 | Health checking is a `curtz healthcheck` subcommand that calls `GET /health` (liveness). | A distroless image has no `curl` or `wget`. Liveness, not readiness, so a Postgres outage does not mark the container unhealthy. |
| D5 | The image sets `ENV ENVIRONMENT=production`. Compose overrides it with `development`. | A container started without `ENVIRONMENT` must refuse the development secrets instead of silently accepting them (slice 3 review finding). |
| D6 | The `app` stack is not part of `core-*` or `full-*`. | `make infra.core.up` and `make infra.full.up` must not trigger an image build. |
| D7 | The app container gets an explicit `environment:` list, not `env_file: .env`. | The `.env` file holds every stack's admin passwords. The app needs a handful of values. |
| D8 | Actions are pinned by commit SHA with a version comment, and Dependabot gets the `docker` and `github-actions` ecosystems. | Pins are only safe if something keeps them current. |
| D9 | `deploy.yml` passes secrets through `env:` and keeps its secret names. | Interpolating `${{ secrets.X }}` into a shell script is an injection risk. Which secrets exist in GitHub is the owner's decision. |
| D10 | Every commit made while implementing this spec ends with the `Co-Authored-By` trailer given in the session's attribution instructions, as the user asked on 2026-10-04. Example `git commit` snippets in plans omit the trailer text. | A project convention, stated here so it survives into the plan. |
| D11 | The mirror pipelines (`.gitlab-ci.yml`, `bitbucket-pipelines.yml`) run the same verification as GitHub: lint, unit tests with coverage, integration tests, e2e tests, the binary build, and for the image hadolint, the build with `scripts/image_test.sh`, and the Trivy scan. Publishing, releases, deploys, Sentry, Slack, CodeQL and Danger stay on GitHub, which also mirrors the repository to both. Requested by the user on 2026-10-04. | Both pipelines were stale (`golang:1.18`) and failed at their first step: they called `make setup-linting`, which is not a target. Parity means a push to a mirror is checked as strictly as one to GitHub. |

## 4. The image

**Build arguments:** `VERSION` (default `unknown`), `GIT_COMMIT` (default `unknown`), `BUILD_TIME` (default `unknown`). They feed
the variables that `app/pkg/version.go` already declares.

**Stage `build`** (the Go toolchain image, an Alpine variant of Go 1.26, tag and digest resolved when implementing and recorded
in the implementation notes appended to this spec):

1. `COPY go.mod go.sum`, then `go mod download && go mod verify` with a BuildKit cache mount for `/go/pkg/mod`.
2. `COPY app ./app` (the allowlisted context, below).
3. `CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -trimpath -buildvcs=false -ldflags "-s -w -X github.com/sanctumlabs/curtz/app/pkg.Version=$VERSION
   -X …GitCommit=$GIT_COMMIT -X …BuildTime=$BUILD_TIME"` for `./app/cmd` (to `/out/curtz`) and `./app/cmd/migrator` (to
   `/out/migrator`), with cache mounts for `/go/pkg/mod` and the build cache. There is no `-mod=mod`, so the build uses `go.sum` as is.

**Final stage** (distroless `static`, newest Debian release it publishes, `:nonroot`, pinned by digest):

- `COPY --from=build /out/curtz /out/migrator /app/` and `COPY app/internal/adapters/postgres/migrations /app/migrations`.
- `WORKDIR /app`, `USER 65532:65532`, `EXPOSE 8085`, `ENTRYPOINT ["/app/curtz"]`.
- `ENV ENVIRONMENT=production` (D5) and `ENV MIGRATIONS_PATH=/app/migrations`.
- `HEALTHCHECK --interval=10s --timeout=3s --start-period=10s --retries=3 CMD ["/app/curtz", "healthcheck"]`.
- OCI labels (`org.opencontainers.image.source`, `.revision`, `.version`, `.created`, `.title`, `.licenses`) from the build arguments.
- No `# syntax=` directive: it would pull a BuildKit frontend image, and the cache mounts work with Docker's built-in frontend.

**`.dockerignore`** becomes an allowlist: ignore everything, then allow `go.mod`, `go.sum` and `app/`, and drop `**/*_test.go` and
`app/test/`. A secret or a new top-level directory can then never enter the context by accident.

**`hadolint.yaml`:** add `gcr.io` to the trusted registries and drop the `DL3017`/`DL3018` ignores (the image no longer uses `apk`).

## 5. The `healthcheck` subcommand

`/app/curtz healthcheck` loads the server settings with `config.LoadServer` (so it honors `HTTP_PORT` and `SERVER_HOST`), calls
`GET http://<host>:<port>/health` with a 2 second timeout, prints one line, and exits 0 on HTTP 200 and 1 otherwise. A host of
`""`, `0.0.0.0` or `::` is dialed as `127.0.0.1`; any other configured host is dialed as given, because `Serve` now binds exactly
the configured host. It does not load `.env`, and it stays in `app/cmd/main.go` so `make run` (`go run app/cmd/main.go`) keeps
working. Tests, written first: success, a non-200 status, a refused connection, a timeout, and the host rewriting rule.

## 6. The `app` compose stack (`deploy/app/compose.yml`)

Included from the root `docker-compose.yml` with `env_file: .env`, like the other stacks.

- Services `app-ha` and `app-single`, profiles `app-ha` and `app-single`, both on the `curtz` network with the alias `curtz-app`.
  They build from the repository `Dockerfile` (`context: ../..`) and tag the result `curtz-app:local`.
- Environment (D7): `ENVIRONMENT=development`, `HTTP_PORT=8085`, `DATABASE_HOST=postgres`, `DATABASE_PORT=5432`,
  `DATABASE_NAME=${PG_DATABASE:-curtzdb}`, `DATABASE_USERNAME=${PG_APP_USER:-curtz-user}`,
  `DATABASE_PASSWORD=${PG_APP_PASSWORD:-curtz-pass}`, `REDIS_USERNAME=${REDIS_USERNAME:-curtz-svc}`,
  `REDIS_PASSWORD=${REDIS_PASSWORD:-curtz-svc}`, `AUTH_SECRET=${AUTH_SECRET:-curtz-secret}`, and `REDIS_ADDRESS` as
  `redis-1:7001` in single mode and `redis-1:7001` to `redis-6:7006` in HA mode. Every `${VAR:-default}` must match
  `.env.example`, which `scripts/infra_env_check.sh` enforces.
- Dependencies: none declared. A `depends_on` into a profile that is not enabled makes `docker compose config` fail (verified on
  Compose 5.5.1), so ordering is the script's job: `infra.sh up app` brings up and waits for Postgres (with its `migrate` job) and
  Redis first, and `restart: unless-stopped` covers a manual start before Postgres is ready. Redis is optional for the app (ADR-0015).
- Hardening: `read_only: true`, `tmpfs: [/tmp]`, `cap_drop: [ALL]`, `security_opt: [no-new-privileges:true]`,
  `restart: unless-stopped`, `stop_grace_period: 20s` (longer than the 15 second `SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT`, so a stop never kills a drain).
- Port `127.0.0.1:8085:8085`, so stop a host-run API first. `SERVER_HOST` is not set: inside a container it must stay `0.0.0.0`.
- `scripts/infra.sh` learns the `app` stack (the mode applies): `up app <mode>` first brings up `postgres` and `redis` for that mode
  through the script itself, then starts the app profile with `--build`; `down app` stops only the app. `scripts/infra_test.sh`
  gets stub-based cases for it, and `make infra.config` must render both profiles.
- Make: `infra.app.up` and `infra.app.down` with `MODE=ha|single`. The global `infra.config`, `infra.ps`, `infra.logs` and `infra.clean`
  cover the app once `app-ha` and `app-single` are in `INFRA_PROFILES`.

## 7. Make, hadolint and Trivy

- `lint.docker` mounts `hadolint.yaml` with an absolute path (today it passes a relative name, which Docker treats as a named volume,
  so the config is never read) and pins the hadolint image by digest (the image already on the machine).
- `scan.docker` builds the image if missing, saves it with `docker save` to a temporary tar and scans that file with a pinned
  Trivy image (`--severity HIGH,CRITICAL --ignore-unfixed --exit-code 1`, a named volume for the vulnerability database). It does
  not mount the Docker socket into the scanner. The empty `scan.docker.image` target is removed.
- `build.docker` passes `VERSION` (`git describe --tags --always --dirty`), `GIT_COMMIT` and `BUILD_TIME`.
- A new `lint.workflows` target runs `actionlint` from a pinned image.

## 8. CI

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `docker.yml` | Rewritten. It checks out `workflow_run.head_sha`. It runs hadolint, builds once and scans with Trivy before anything is pushed, then builds `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` and pushes to Docker Hub and GHCR in one step with SBOM and provenance. It has least-privilege `permissions` and a GitHub Actions layer cache. The existing triggers and registries are unchanged. |
| `build_app.yml` | `go-version-file: go.mod` instead of `1.18.x`, `actions/upload-artifact@v4` (v2 and v3 no longer run), and the checkout fixed as above. |
| `tests.yml`, `lint.yml` | The Go version input goes from `1.25` to `1.26` to match `go.mod`. |
| `codeql.yml` | Current CodeQL action versions and checkout. |
| `release.yml`, `sentry.yml`, `dangerci.yml`, `slack.yml`, `bitbucket_sync.yml`, `gitlab_sync.yml` | Current action versions, Go from `go.mod` where it is set (`sentry.yml`), Node 22 instead of the end-of-life 16 (`dangerci.yml`). |
| `deploy.yml` | Current checkout, `setup-flyctl` pinned instead of `@master`, and secrets passed through `env:` (D9). Secret names unchanged. |
| every workflow | A minimal `permissions:` block, and actions pinned by SHA with a version comment (D8). |
| `dependabot.yml` | Adds the `docker` and `github-actions` ecosystems next to `gomod`. |

SHAs are resolved with `gh api` when implementing. If a pinned action's behavior changes (inputs renamed between major versions),
the workflow is adjusted to the current documented inputs.

## 8b. Mirror CI (GitLab and Bitbucket)

Both pipelines follow the GitHub order, Lint, then Tests, then Build, then the image checks, and use the same commands and tool
versions: `golang:1.26` (the minor version in `go.mod`), `golangci/golangci-lint:v2.13.2` (the version `make lint` pins),
`hadolint/hadolint:v2.15.1-debian`, `aquasec/trivy:0.75.0`, and Docker 29.8.

- Tests: `make test.coverage` (GitLab reads the total from `go tool cover -func`), `make test.integration`, `make test.e2e`. The last two
  start containers through testcontainers, so they run with a Docker daemon: Docker-in-Docker on GitLab (`docker:29.8-dind`,
  `DOCKER_HOST`, `TESTCONTAINERS_HOST_OVERRIDE=docker`) and the `docker` service on Bitbucket, both with `TESTCONTAINERS_RYUK_DISABLED=true`.
- Build: `make build` on Linux only. GitHub also builds on macOS and Windows; the mirrors have no such runners by default.
- Image: hadolint runs in its own image, the image is built and checked with `scripts/image_test.sh image`, saved to a tar, and Trivy
  scans the tar in its own image with the same flags as `make scan.docker`. `make scan.docker` itself is not reused: it bind-mounts a
  temporary directory into the scanner, and under Docker-in-Docker that path would refer to the daemon's filesystem.
- Bitbucket defines each step once (YAML anchors) and uses it for `default` and for pull requests; the old `branches: main` copy was
  identical and is gone. GitLab skips the duplicate branch pipeline when a merge request is open.
- `scripts/mirror_ci_check.sh`, run by `make lint.workflows`, checks the files without running them: they parse as YAML; every Go image
  matches `go.mod` (also `.gitlab/.gitlab-webide.yml`, whose `go:1.18` was not even a valid image); each mirror runs every test and build
  command the GitHub workflows run, the golangci-lint image `make lint` pins, hadolint, `docker build`, `scripts/image_test.sh image`, and
  Trivy with the same flags; no image is `:latest`; Ryuk is disabled; every `make` target a mirror calls exists.
- Not verifiable here: neither GitLab nor Bitbucket pipelines can be run locally, so a mirror's first real run is the first push GitHub
  makes to it. The commands themselves were run locally exactly as the jobs run them.

## 9. Verification plan

Written test-first where there is code (the `healthcheck` subcommand, `infra.sh` cases); everything else is verified by running it.

- `make lint.docker`: no findings. `actionlint` on every workflow: no findings.
- `docker build` cold and cached; image size recorded; the build context shows no `.env` or `.git` (a debug build that lists `/src`).
- The container runs as uid 65532; `docker run --entrypoint sh …` fails (no shell); `--read-only --cap-drop ALL --security-opt
  no-new-privileges` still serves `/health/ready`; the Docker health status becomes `healthy`.
- `docker run --entrypoint /app/migrator …` against the stack: first run applies or "no change", second run "no change".
- `docker run -e ENVIRONMENT=production …` without secrets exits 1 naming the variables (the image default, D5).
- `make scan.docker`: no fixable HIGH or CRITICAL finding (any exception is listed with its reason in the implementation notes).
- `scripts/mirror_ci_check.sh` fails on each kind of drift (Go image, a dropped Trivy flag, the golangci-lint version, a missing make
  target, an `:latest` image, Ryuk left on) and passes on the pipelines; the commands the mirror jobs run (`make test.coverage`,
  `make test.integration`, `make test.e2e`, the image build, checks and scan) pass locally.
- `make infra.app.up MODE=single` and `MODE=ha`: `ready`, `healthy`, `/health/ready` ok, a registration returns 201; Redis stopped gives
  `degraded`; SIGTERM through `docker compose stop app-…` exits 0 inside the grace period; `make infra.app.down` removes only the app.
- `bash scripts/infra_test.sh`, `make infra.config` and `go test ./...` stay green.

## 10. Documentation

`docs/LocalInfrastructure.md` gains the `app` stack (commands, the port conflict with a host-run API, why there is no shell and how to
debug with the `:debug` distroless tag). `docs/Deployment.md` gains the image contract: the contents, the `ENVIRONMENT` default, the
healthcheck, the migrator entrypoint and the variables production must set. The README Docker paragraph points at both. ADR-0016
records D1, D2 and D5: the runtime image is distroless static, carries the migrator, and defaults to production.

## 11. Risks and open items

- **Downloads.** Building and verifying needs images that are not local: the Go toolchain image, the distroless image, Trivy (plus its
  vulnerability database) and `actionlint`. Each is pulled only with the user's go-ahead before the first build, as in slice 1.
- **CI is unproven until it runs on GitHub.** `actionlint` catches syntax and input errors, not runtime behavior. The multi-arch build
  adds emulated arm64 time to the workflow.
- **`deploy.yml` still publishes Mongo-era Fly secrets** (`DATABASE`, `CACHE_*`, `AUTH_EXPIRE`) that the app no longer reads. Production
  needs `DATABASE_*` (or `DATABASE_URL`), `REDIS_ADDRESS`, `REDIS_PASSWORD`, `AUTH_SECRET` and the rest of the contract in `.env.example`.
  Those secret names are the owner's call, and `fly.toml` (`ENV`, `PORT`) has the same mismatch. With D5 the app now refuses to start on
  Fly until they are set, which is the intended fail-fast.
- **No shell in the image.** Debugging uses the `:debug` distroless tag, documented in §10.
- **The mirror pipelines are unproven until they run.** Docker-in-Docker with testcontainers is the usual way to run these tests on
  GitLab and Bitbucket, but only the first push shows whether a given runner allows it. Their tool images are pinned by version, not
  by digest (Dependabot cannot read `.gitlab-ci.yml` or `bitbucket-pipelines.yml`), so `scripts/mirror_ci_check.sh` keeps them in
  step with the repository instead.
- **Lint fails on all three CIs today.** `golangci-lint run` reports 35 findings in code that predates these slices (logger, jwtauth,
  errdefs and others) and GitHub's Lint workflow is already red for the same reason. The mirror lint jobs inherit that until the
  findings are fixed; a baseline (`new-from-rev`) or a clean-up is a separate decision.
- **Digest pins go stale** without Dependabot; D8 adds it, but it only opens pull requests.

## 12. Implementation notes

Verified on 2026-10-04, Docker Desktop for Mac (arm64), Compose 5.5.1, Docker 29.8.0.

Images and tools:

- Builder `golang:1.26-alpine@sha256:8ac98ca534ac3f51e1f420a1dd2c15e74c75cfa0f23f3ad27eb5d7236c349a0c`; runtime
  `gcr.io/distroless/static-debian13:nonroot@sha256:e2e927ec666bae08560abb3c55d0659eceabb657f56b6782ab500a9fc7f555e3` (Debian 13.7;
  `debian13` exists, so no fallback to `debian12`). hadolint is the local `hadolint/hadolint@sha256:32dac94127fd60b7b7e3fbfc65e1383b9b5e25c9bfd7b8536de7a539fe68a12d`
  (2.15.1), Trivy `aquasec/trivy:0.75.0`, actionlint `rhysd/actionlint:1.7.12`. All 18 GitHub Action pins in the plan matched GitHub when
  they were applied.
- Image size 55.5 MB (`docker image inspect .Size`), two static binaries plus the migrations.

Checks:

- `scripts/image_test.sh context`: the build context holds the sources and migrations only. With the old empty `.dockerignore` the same
  listing showed `.env`, `.env.example`, the whole `.git` directory and `.superpowers/`.
- `scripts/image_test.sh image`: all 12 checks pass (uid 65532, `HEALTHCHECK /app/curtz healthcheck`, entrypoint, `ENVIRONMENT=production`,
  `MIGRATIONS_PATH`, OCI source label, no shell, refuses to start without secrets and prints no value, migrator present, two migrations
  shipped, healthcheck works read-only without capabilities).
- hadolint clean; `actionlint` and `scripts/workflows_check.sh` clean on every workflow.
- Trivy (HIGH and CRITICAL, fixable only): the first scan found three findings in `google.golang.org/grpc v1.81.0` inside `app/curtz`
  (CVE-2026-84304, CVE-2026-84445, GHSA-hrxh-6v49-42gf). With your approval `grpc` moved to v1.83.2 (with the indirect
  `genproto/googleapis/rpc`); the rescan shows 0 for Debian 13.7, `app/curtz` and `app/migrator`. Build, vet, unit and e2e tests and
  `go mod verify` stayed green.

Live drills (Postgres and Redis stacks plus the app, single then HA):

- `make infra.app.up MODE=single`: `ready` for Postgres, Redis and the app; the container is `healthy`, runs as `65532:65532`, with a
  read-only root, `CapDrop=[ALL]` and `no-new-privileges`. Its environment holds 13 variables and none of the other stacks' admin
  passwords (decision D7). `GET /health/ready` is `ok`; a registration returns 201.
- Redis stopped: `degraded` with HTTP 200; started again: `ok` within 8 seconds, no restart of the app.
- The migrator from the image (`--entrypoint /app/migrator`, `MIGRATIONS_PATH=/app/migrations`): `migrate: no change`, exit 0, in both modes.
- Stop drill (Review Focus 4): an idle `docker compose stop` takes 1 second and exits 0 with the draining log lines. With a request held
  half-sent, the stop takes 15 seconds (`SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT`) and exits 1 with `shut down within 15s: context deadline exceeded`, never 137,
  because `stop_grace_period` (20s) is longer than the drain.
- `make infra.app.down` removes only the app; Postgres and Redis keep running.
- `make infra.app.up MODE=ha`: switches Postgres and Redis to HA, then `ready: app-ha`, `healthy`, readiness `ok` with all six Redis
  addresses, registration 201, migrator `no change`, stop exits 0.

Findings:

- `docker save <repository>` with no tag exports every local tag of the repository, and Trivy refuses a tar with more than one image.
  `make scan.docker` therefore saves exactly one reference (the given tag, or `<name>:latest`), and runs Trivy with `--quiet --no-progress`.
  Trivy's vulnerability database is about 121 MB and is cached in the named volume `curtz-trivy-cache`.
- `make scan.docker` bind-mounts a temporary directory into the scanner. That works on a developer machine but not under Docker-in-Docker,
  where the path would refer to the daemon's filesystem, so the mirror CI jobs do not reuse that target.
