# Outbox Relay and Kafka Client Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Deliver the transactional outbox to Kafka: a `cmd/worker` process, one leader-elected relay that publishes `outbox_events` rows to their topics with at-least-once delivery, per-key order, parking of events Kafka permanently rejects, a purge of old sent rows and trace continuity from the request that wrote the event, plus the small franz-go producer it uses.

**Architecture:** The relay use case (`internal/application/outbox`) depends on two ports: `ports.OutboxDatastore` (Postgres adapter: purpose-built sqlc queries and an advisory-lock lease on its own connection) and `ports.EventPublisher` (Kafka adapter over a franz-go producer in `pkg/infra/queue/kafka`). The worker (`app/cmd/worker`) wires them with the slice 3 and 4 building blocks (strict config loader, slog JSON logger, OpenTelemetry, health registry) behind a small `net/http` health listener, and ships in the existing image as `/app/worker` with its own compose stack.

**Tech Stack:** Go 1.26, pgx v5 and sqlc, franz-go v1.22.1, golang-migrate, OpenTelemetry v1.44, testify, testcontainers (Postgres, and a generic container for Kafka).

**Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-05-outbox-relay-design.md` (decisions D1–D14 are binding; this plan argues from it, and the amendments the planning found are already in the spec).

## Global Constraints

- Go `1.26.0` (`go.mod`). All commands run from the repo root `/Users/lusina/Projects/SanctumLabs/curtz`, on branch `feat/outbox-relay`.
- **Commit trailer (D14):** every commit made while executing this plan ends with the `Co-Authored-By` trailer given in the session's attribution instructions. The `git commit` snippets below omit the trailer text on purpose; add it to each commit.
- **Download gate:** nothing is downloaded without the user's explicit go-ahead naming source and size. franz-go v1.22.1, `pkg/kmsg` v1.14.0, `github.com/pierrec/lz4/v4` v4.1.30 and `github.com/klauspost/compress` v1.20.0 are all in the local module cache: Task 6 adds them with `GOPROXY=off`, which fails instead of downloading. Adding franz-go raises the existing indirect requirement `klauspost/compress` from v1.18.6 to v1.20.0: that is a version bump of a library in the production binary, so Task 6 asks for it. Two things do need the network and the go-ahead: `go mod tidy` (Task 6) and the Docker image build (Tasks 13 and 16: the builder runs `go mod download`).
- **No Docker pulls:** every image the plan uses is already local: `apache/kafka:4.3.1`, `postgres:16.2-alpine`, `testcontainers/ryuk`, the pinned `hadolint/hadolint@sha256:32dac94…` (use `make lint.docker`, never `docker run hadolint/hadolint:<tag>`), `prom/prometheus:v3.15.0` (for `promtool`) and the observability and ELK images. Run `docker images` before any `docker run` of an image you have not used before.
- **Docker must be running** for the integration tests and the drill (`docker info`); start Docker Desktop if it is not.
- Do not modify `.env` (the developer's own, gitignored file) or `/etc/hosts`. Never remove paths with `$(...)` or an unquoted variable in `rm`: print the path and remove the literal path.
- Environment variable names, defaults and units are exactly the spec's section 7 table. Error text from the config loader names variables and never values.
- The API process never connects to Kafka (ADR-0015); only the worker does. The worker never migrates (ADR-0014).
- Never put a payload, a message key, a header value, an email address or a token in a span or a metric label (the publish span carries the event ID, the destination and the event type only).
- Unit tests are untagged; Docker-backed tests carry `//go:build integration`. Use testify `require`/`assert`. `go test ./...` must be green at the end of every task.
- Format every Go file you create or edit with `gofmt -w` (do not reformat files you only touch elsewhere: `app/config/database.go` and others are not gofmt-clean and are out of scope).
- Before starting any Docker stack check `docker ps`: the developer's own containers must not be disturbed.

## Plan notes (where the code found while planning sharpens the spec's wording)

The code in this plan was written and run in a scratch copy of the repository first (unit tests, race detector, `golangci-lint`, and every Docker-backed test against real Postgres and Kafka containers), so the snippets are tested code; these are the things that testing taught.

1. **franz-go's ordering is guaranteed by the library** (read in its source): `RecordDeliveryTimeout` and `RecordRetries` fail every record buffered for a partition after the one that fails, and records are produced in order per partition. The per-key serial fallback the spec's first draft held in reserve is not needed (the spec says so now).
2. **A bounded `Produce` needs `AllowIdempotentProduceCancellation`.** The broker-stop test hung for more than ten minutes: by default franz-go will not fail a record whose request is already on its way, so a broker that dies mid-request keeps `ProduceSync` waiting until it returns, deadline or not. The producer allows cancellation of in-flight records and bounds every call with the publish timeout; the price is a possible duplicate, which at-least-once delivery already allows.
3. **`IsPermanent` is an explicit allowlist** (`MessageTooLarge`, `RecordListTooLarge`, `InvalidTopicException`, `InvalidRecord`, `UnsupportedForMessageFormat`, `TopicAuthorizationFailed`, `ClusterAuthorizationFailed`), not "every non-retriable `kerr`", so an unknown server error can never park an event. It lives in `pkg/infra/queue/kafka`; the adapter calls it.
4. **A client-side "record too large" needs a broker.** franz-go checks the size once it knows the topic's partitions, so the oversized-record test is an integration test.
5. **The relay waits one standby interval after losing its lease** before asking for it again, so a connection that keeps dying right after it opens cannot become a hot loop (found by a failing test).
6. **The test broker is a generic testcontainers container** with the local `apache/kafka:4.3.1` image, configured like the stack's `kafka-single` and binding a fixed host port (`app/test/test_kafka.go`). The testcontainers Kafka module is therefore not needed and not added (spec section 11 expected it).
7. **`telemetry.Start` moves out of the API's `main`.** The slice 4 helper `startTelemetry` (and its tests) becomes `telemetry.Start`, shared by the API and the worker; `telemetry.ServiceName` takes a fallback and `Options` gains `ServiceName` so the worker is `curtz-worker`. The API's behaviour is unchanged.
8. **The lease connection is parsed through `pgxpool.ParseConfig`**: `postgres.ConnectionString` carries `pool_max_conns` and `pool_min_conns`, which a plain `pgx.Connect` would send to the server as unknown settings.
9. **A permanently rejected event is retried on the next cycle**, so its attempts are used up within a few cycles (milliseconds apart), not minutes apart. Transient failures never count.
10. **Prometheus names of the relay metrics are predicted** (`outbox_relay_published_total`, `..._failures_total`, `..._publish_duration_seconds_*`, `..._oldest_unsent_age_seconds`, `..._backlog`, `..._parked_rows`, `..._leader`) from OpenTelemetry's naming; Task 16 confirms them on the running stack and fixes the alert and dashboard queries if they differ.

## Review Focus

Failure modes the spec implies but the obvious tests do not cover, most likely first. Each has a pinning test or drill in the owning task.

1. A Kafka outage must neither park events nor wedge the relay or its shutdown: events wait in the table and flow in order when Kafka returns → Task 6 (`..._ABatchThatFailsDuringAnOutageIsDeliveredInOrderAfterwards`, which hung until `AllowIdempotentProduceCancellation` was added), Task 12 (`..._DrainsTheBacklogInOrderOnceKafkaIsBack`) and the Task 16 drill.
2. Two relays at once (a leader that has not noticed it lost the lease, a failover) may duplicate but must never lose, and the standby must take over → Task 5 (lease tests) and Task 12 (`..._OnlyOneOfTwoRelaysPublishesAndTheOtherTakesOverWhenItStops`).
3. A batch in flight when the process is told to stop must be recorded as sent, not left to be published twice → Task 4 (`..._FinishesAndRecordsTheBatchInFlightWhenToldToStop`) and Task 11 (the wiring test: the stop returns without an error and frees the lock) and the Task 16 drill (SIGTERM during a batch).
4. One poison event must not stop the others, and a destination whose topic is missing must not starve the rest → Task 4 (`..._APermanentRejectionDoesNotStopTheOtherEvents`), Task 5 (claim per destination) and Task 12 (`..._ParksAnEventKafkaRejectsAndKeepsDeliveringTheRest`).
5. Polling every 100 ms must not start a trace per query, and nothing from a payload may reach a span → Task 4 (`..._RunsItsHousekeepingQueriesUnderAnUnsampledParent`, `..._PublishSpansContinueTheStoredTraceAndCarryNoPayload`).

### Task 1: Migration 000003 and the relay queries

**Files:**
- Create: `app/internal/adapters/postgres/migrations/000003_outbox_relay.up.sql`, `000003_outbox_relay.down.sql`
- Create: `app/internal/adapters/postgres/sql/queries/outbox/outbox_relay_queries.sql`
- Modify: `app/internal/adapters/postgres/sql/schema.sql`, `app/pkg/infra/database/postgres/migrator_integration_test.go`
- Regenerate: `app/internal/adapters/postgres/sql/models.go`, `outbox_read_queries.sql.go`, `outbox_write_queries.sql.go`, and create `outbox_relay_queries.sql.go`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing from earlier tasks.
- Produces: columns `outbox_events.attempts` (int, default 0) and `parked_at` (timestamptz, null); indexes `ix_outbox_events_unsent_idx` (partial on unsent, unparked, undeleted) and `ix_outbox_events_sent_time_purge_idx`; sqlc functions `QueryClaimOutboxEvents(ctx, perDestination int32) ([]QueryClaimOutboxEventsRow, error)`, `QueryMarkOutboxEventsSent(ctx, ids []pgtype.UUID) (int64, error)`, `QueryRecordOutboxEventRejection(ctx, params) (int32, error)`, `QueryParkOutboxEvent(ctx, params) error`, `QueryPurgeSentOutboxEvents(ctx, params) (int64, error)`, `QueryOutboxBacklog(ctx) (QueryOutboxBacklogRow, error)`. Task 5 wraps them.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing migration tests**

In `app/pkg/infra/database/postgres/migrator_integration_test.go` add `"os"` to the imports (keep them sorted) and append:

```go
// The outbox relay (spec 2026-10-05) counts rejections, parks events and claims unsent rows per destination in creation
// order; the columns and the partial indexes are what it relies on.
func TestMigrate_AddsTheOutboxRelayColumnsAndIndexes(t *testing.T) {
	ctx := context.Background()
	container, err := test.TestPostgresDatabaseContainer(ctx, test.DefaultTestDatabaseConfig())
	require.NoError(t, err)
	t.Cleanup(func() { _ = container.Terminate(context.Background()) })
	connectionString, err := container.ConnectionString(ctx, "sslmode=disable")
	require.NoError(t, err)
	require.NoError(t, test.RunDatabaseMigration(ctx, connectionString))

	pool, err := pgxpool.New(ctx, connectionString)
	require.NoError(t, err)
	t.Cleanup(pool.Close)

	var attempts, parkedAt string
	require.NoError(t, pool.QueryRow(ctx, `SELECT
		(SELECT data_type || '/' || is_nullable || '/' || column_default FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'outbox_events' AND column_name = 'attempts'),
		(SELECT data_type || '/' || is_nullable FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'outbox_events' AND column_name = 'parked_at')`).Scan(&attempts, &parkedAt))
	assert.Equal(t, "integer/NO/0", attempts)
	assert.Equal(t, "timestamp with time zone/YES", parkedAt)

	for index, predicate := range map[string]string{
		"ix_outbox_events_unsent_idx":          "sent_time IS NULL",
		"ix_outbox_events_sent_time_purge_idx": "sent_time IS NOT NULL",
	} {
		var definition string
		require.NoError(t, pool.QueryRow(ctx, "SELECT indexdef FROM pg_indexes WHERE indexname = $1", index).Scan(&definition), index)
		assert.Contains(t, definition, predicate, "%s is a partial index", index)
	}
}

func TestMigration000003_CanBeRolledBackAndAppliedAgain(t *testing.T) {
	ctx := context.Background()
	container, err := test.TestPostgresDatabaseContainer(ctx, test.DefaultTestDatabaseConfig())
	require.NoError(t, err)
	t.Cleanup(func() { _ = container.Terminate(context.Background()) })
	connectionString, err := container.ConnectionString(ctx, "sslmode=disable")
	require.NoError(t, err)
	require.NoError(t, test.RunDatabaseMigration(ctx, connectionString))
	pool, err := pgxpool.New(ctx, connectionString)
	require.NoError(t, err)
	t.Cleanup(pool.Close)

	const dir = "../../../../internal/adapters/postgres/migrations/"
	down, err := os.ReadFile(dir + "000003_outbox_relay.down.sql")
	require.NoError(t, err)
	up, err := os.ReadFile(dir + "000003_outbox_relay.up.sql")
	require.NoError(t, err)
	relayObjects := func() (columns, indexes int) {
		require.NoError(t, pool.QueryRow(ctx, `SELECT
			(SELECT count(*) FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'outbox_events' AND column_name IN ('attempts', 'parked_at')),
			(SELECT count(*) FROM pg_indexes WHERE indexname IN ('ix_outbox_events_unsent_idx', 'ix_outbox_events_sent_time_purge_idx'))`).Scan(&columns, &indexes))
		return columns, indexes
	}

	columns, indexes := relayObjects()
	require.Equal(t, [2]int{2, 2}, [2]int{columns, indexes}, "applied")

	_, err = pool.Exec(ctx, string(down))
	require.NoError(t, err)
	columns, indexes = relayObjects()
	assert.Equal(t, [2]int{0, 0}, [2]int{columns, indexes}, "rolled back: no column and no index is left")

	_, err = pool.Exec(ctx, string(up))
	require.NoError(t, err)
	columns, indexes = relayObjects()
	assert.Equal(t, [2]int{2, 2}, [2]int{columns, indexes}, "applied again")
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run them to verify they fail**

Run: `go test -tags integration -count=1 -run 'TestMigrate_AddsTheOutboxRelay|TestMigration000003' ./app/pkg/infra/database/postgres`
Expected: FAIL (`Received unexpected error` reading the columns, and `no such file` for the 000003 files). Docker must be running.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the migration**

Create `app/internal/adapters/postgres/migrations/000003_outbox_relay.up.sql`:

```sql
BEGIN;

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Outbox relay (see docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-05-outbox-relay-design.md).
--
-- attempts counts the times the broker permanently rejected an event; transient failures (the broker being down) are not
-- counted. parked_at is set when the relay gives up on an event after the maximum number of attempts; the row stays
-- visible with its error_message and can be re-queued with: UPDATE outbox_events SET parked_at = NULL, attempts = 0 WHERE id = '...'
--
-- The first index serves the relay's claim query (unsent, unparked, undeleted rows per destination in creation order),
-- the second its purge of old sent rows.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALTER TABLE outbox_events
    ADD COLUMN attempts  INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    ADD COLUMN parked_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NULL;

COMMENT ON COLUMN outbox_events.attempts IS 'Times the broker permanently rejected this event; transient failures are not counted';
COMMENT ON COLUMN outbox_events.parked_at IS 'When the relay gave up on this event after the maximum number of attempts; null if not parked';

CREATE INDEX ix_outbox_events_unsent_idx ON outbox_events (destination, created_at, id)
    WHERE sent_time IS NULL AND parked_at IS NULL AND deleted_at IS NULL;
CREATE INDEX ix_outbox_events_sent_time_purge_idx ON outbox_events (sent_time)
    WHERE sent_time IS NOT NULL;

COMMIT;
```

Create `app/internal/adapters/postgres/migrations/000003_outbox_relay.down.sql`:

```sql
BEGIN;

DROP INDEX IF EXISTS ix_outbox_events_sent_time_purge_idx;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS ix_outbox_events_unsent_idx;

ALTER TABLE outbox_events
    DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS parked_at,
    DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS attempts;

COMMIT;
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the migration tests**

Run: `go test -tags integration -count=1 -run 'TestMigrate|TestMigration000003' ./app/pkg/infra/database/postgres`
Expected: `ok` (the three tests apply the migrations, find the columns and partial indexes, and roll `000003` back and forward again).

- [ ] **Step 5: Mirror the change in `schema.sql` for sqlc**

In `app/internal/adapters/postgres/sql/schema.sql`: in `CREATE TABLE outbox_events`, between `processing_at` and `created_at` add

```sql
    attempts        INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    parked_at       TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NULL,
```

after the line `COMMENT ON INDEX ix_outbox_events_created_at_event_type_idx IS ...;` add

```sql
CREATE INDEX ix_outbox_events_unsent_idx ON outbox_events (destination, created_at, id) WHERE sent_time IS NULL AND parked_at IS NULL AND deleted_at IS NULL;
CREATE INDEX ix_outbox_events_sent_time_purge_idx ON outbox_events (sent_time) WHERE sent_time IS NOT NULL;
```

and before `COMMENT ON COLUMN outbox_events.group_id IS ...` add

```sql
COMMENT ON COLUMN outbox_events.attempts IS 'Times the broker permanently rejected this event; transient failures are not counted';
COMMENT ON COLUMN outbox_events.parked_at IS 'When the relay gave up on this event after the maximum number of attempts; null if not parked';
```

- [ ] **Step 6: Write the relay queries and regenerate the Go code**

Create `app/internal/adapters/postgres/sql/queries/outbox/outbox_relay_queries.sql`:

```sql
-- name: QueryClaimOutboxEvents :many
-- The relay's batch: per destination, the oldest unsent, unparked, undeleted events in creation order, so a destination
-- whose topic is unavailable cannot starve the others. The creation order is (created_at, id); id is a UUIDv7 and keeps
-- the events of one transaction in the order they were recorded.
SELECT
  ranked.id,
  ranked.partition_key,
  ranked.destination,
  ranked.event_type,
  ranked.headers,
  ranked.payload,
  ranked.attempts,
  ranked.created_at
FROM (
  SELECT
    oe.*,
    row_number() OVER (PARTITION BY oe.destination ORDER BY oe.created_at, oe.id) AS position
  FROM outbox_events oe
  WHERE oe.sent_time IS NULL
    AND oe.parked_at IS NULL
    AND oe.deleted_at IS NULL
) ranked
WHERE ranked.position <= sqlc.arg(per_destination)::int
ORDER BY ranked.created_at, ranked.id;

-- name: QueryMarkOutboxEventsSent :execrows
UPDATE outbox_events
SET
  sent_time = now(),
  updated_at = now()
WHERE id = ANY(sqlc.arg(ids)::uuid[])
  AND sent_time IS NULL;

-- name: QueryRecordOutboxEventRejection :one
UPDATE outbox_events
SET
  attempts = attempts + 1,
  error_message = sqlc.arg(error_message),
  updated_at = now()
WHERE id = sqlc.arg(id)
RETURNING attempts;

-- name: QueryParkOutboxEvent :exec
UPDATE outbox_events
SET
  parked_at = now(),
  error_message = sqlc.arg(error_message),
  updated_at = now()
WHERE id = sqlc.arg(id);

-- name: QueryPurgeSentOutboxEvents :execrows
DELETE FROM outbox_events
WHERE id IN (
  SELECT oe.id
  FROM outbox_events oe
  WHERE oe.sent_time IS NOT NULL
    AND oe.sent_time < sqlc.arg(older_than)::timestamptz
  ORDER BY oe.sent_time
  LIMIT sqlc.arg(limit_by)::int
);

-- name: QueryOutboxBacklog :one
SELECT
  count(*) FILTER (WHERE parked_at IS NULL)::bigint AS unsent,
  (min(created_at) FILTER (WHERE parked_at IS NULL))::timestamptz AS oldest_unsent,
  count(*) FILTER (WHERE parked_at IS NOT NULL)::bigint AS parked
FROM outbox_events
WHERE sent_time IS NULL
  AND deleted_at IS NULL;
```

Run:

```bash
~/go/bin/sqlc version        # expect v1.31.1, the version in the headers of the generated files
~/go/bin/sqlc generate
git status --short app/internal/adapters/postgres/sql
go build ./...
```

Expected: `v1.31.1`; changes only in `models.go` (two new fields on `OutboxEvent`), `outbox_read_queries.sql.go` and `outbox_write_queries.sql.go` (their `Scan` lists gain the two columns), `schema.sql`, and the new files `outbox_relay_queries.sql` and `outbox_relay_queries.sql.go`; the build is clean. If sqlc reports another version or rewrites unrelated generated files, stop and ask.

- [ ] **Step 7: Run the suites that touch the outbox**

Run: `go test ./... && go test -tags integration -count=1 ./app/internal/adapters/postgres/...`
Expected: all `ok` (the existing outbox integration test still passes with the two extra columns).

- [ ] **Step 8: Commit**

```bash
git add app/internal/adapters/postgres app/pkg/infra/database/postgres
git commit -m "feat(outbox): add the relay columns, indexes and queries"
```

### Task 2: The writer stores the request's trace context

**Files:**
- Modify: `app/internal/adapters/postgres/outbox.go`
- Create: `app/internal/adapters/postgres/outbox_test.go`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing.
- Produces: `WriteOutboxEvents` adds `traceparent` (and `tracestate` when set) to the stored `headers` when the context carries a valid span context, using `propagation.TraceContext{}` directly (never baggage). Task 4's relay reads them from the claimed event's `Headers`.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run them to verify they fail**

Run: `go test -count=1 -run TestWriteOutboxEvents ./app/internal/adapters/postgres`
Expected: FAIL `TestWriteOutboxEvents_StoresTheTraceContextOfTheRequestThatWroteTheEvent` and `..._AnUnsampledSpanIsStoredWithItsFlagSoTheRelayStaysUnsampled` (no `traceparent` header); the other two pass.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

In `app/internal/adapters/postgres/outbox.go` add `"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/propagation"` to the imports (third-party group, after the curtz imports), replace the `outboxHeaders` type with

```go
// outboxHeaders are the message headers a relay forwards alongside the payload. TraceParent and TraceState are the W3C
// trace context of the request that wrote the event, so the relay can continue its trace; they are absent when the
// writer had no span.
type outboxHeaders struct {
	EventID     string    `json:"event_id"`
	EventType   string    `json:"event_type"`
	AggregateID string    `json:"aggregate_id"`
	OccurredAt  time.Time `json:"occurred_at"`
	TraceParent string    `json:"traceparent,omitempty"`
	TraceState  string    `json:"tracestate,omitempty"`
}
```

add above `WriteOutboxEvents`

```go
// traceHeaders returns the traceparent and tracestate of the span in ctx. It uses the W3C trace-context propagator
// directly rather than the global one, so baggage, which can carry user data, is never stored with an event.
func traceHeaders(ctx context.Context) (traceParent, traceState string) {
	carrier := propagation.MapCarrier{}
	propagation.TraceContext{}.Inject(ctx, carrier)
	return carrier.Get("traceparent"), carrier.Get("tracestate")
}
```

in `WriteOutboxEvents` add `traceParent, traceState := traceHeaders(ctx)` as the first line before the `for` loop, and add `TraceParent: traceParent,` and `TraceState: traceState,` to the `outboxHeaders{...}` literal after `OccurredAt`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `gofmt -l app/internal/adapters/postgres; go test -race -count=1 ./app/internal/adapters/postgres`
Expected: no gofmt output; `ok`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add app/internal/adapters/postgres
git commit -m "feat(outbox): store the trace context of the writing request in the event headers"
```

### Task 3: The ports and message building

**Files:**
- Create: `app/internal/ports/outbox.go`
- Modify: `app/internal/ports/event_bus.go` (currently only `package ports`)
- Create: `app/internal/application/outbox/message.go`, `message_test.go`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Task 2's stored headers (read as a map).
- Produces: `ports.OutboxEvent`, `ports.Backlog`, `ports.Lease`, `ports.OutboxDatastore`, `ports.ErrNotLeader`, `ports.Header`, `ports.Message`, `ports.PublishResult`, `ports.EventPublisher`; in package `outbox`: `buildMessage(spanCtx context.Context, event ports.OutboxEvent) ports.Message`, `storedTraceContext(ctx, event) context.Context`, `mapCarrier`. Tasks 4, 5 and 7 use them.

}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run them to verify they fail**

Run: `go test ./app/internal/application/outbox`
Expected: build failure: the package has no non-test Go files, `undefined: buildMessage`, `undefined: ports.OutboxEvent` (and `ports.Message`).

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the ports**

Create `app/internal/ports/outbox.go`:

```go
package ports

import (
	"context"
	"errors"
	"time"
)

// ErrNotLeader is returned by OutboxDatastore.Acquire when another relay instance holds the lock.
var ErrNotLeader = errors.New("outbox relay: another instance is the leader")

// OutboxEvent is an event waiting in the transactional outbox (ADR-0011) to be delivered to a broker.
type OutboxEvent struct {
	// ID is the domain event's ID; consumers de-duplicate on it.
	ID string
	// Destination is the logical stream the event goes to, which is also the topic name.
	Destination string
	// PartitionKey orders and partitions the event on the broker, usually the aggregate ID. Empty when the row has none.
	PartitionKey string
	EventType    string
	// Headers are the stored message headers: event_id, event_type, aggregate_id, occurred_at and, when the writer had
	// a span, traceparent and tracestate.
	Headers map[string]string
	// Payload is the event's JSON, forwarded untouched.
	Payload []byte
	// Attempts is how many times the broker permanently rejected this event so far.
	Attempts  int
	CreatedAt time.Time
}

// Backlog describes what the relay has not delivered yet.
type Backlog struct {
	// Unsent counts events waiting for delivery (parked ones excluded).
	Unsent int64
	// OldestUnsent is when the oldest waiting event was written; the zero time when none waits.
	OldestUnsent time.Time
	// Parked counts events the relay gave up on.
	Parked int64
}

// Lease is the right to relay, held until Release or until the connection that holds it dies.
type Lease interface {
	// Alive reports whether the lease is still held, by using the connection that holds it.
	Alive(ctx context.Context) error
	// Release gives the lease up.
	Release()
}

// OutboxDatastore is what the outbox relay needs from the database.
type OutboxDatastore interface {
	// Acquire takes the relay lease, or returns ErrNotLeader when another instance holds it.
	Acquire(ctx context.Context) (Lease, error)
	// Claim returns up to perDestination of the oldest unsent, unparked events of every destination, in creation order.
	Claim(ctx context.Context, perDestination int) ([]OutboxEvent, error)
	// MarkSent records that the events were acknowledged by the broker.
	MarkSent(ctx context.Context, ids []string) error
	// RecordRejection counts a permanent rejection of the event by the broker and returns how many it has had.
	RecordRejection(ctx context.Context, id, reason string) (attempts int, err error)
	// Park stops the relay from retrying the event; the row stays, with its reason.
	Park(ctx context.Context, id, reason string) error
	// Purge deletes up to limit events sent before olderThan and returns how many it deleted.
	Purge(ctx context.Context, olderThan time.Time, limit int) (int, error)
	// Backlog reports the undelivered and parked events.
	Backlog(ctx context.Context) (Backlog, error)
}
```

Replace the whole of `app/internal/ports/event_bus.go` with:

```go
package ports

import "context"

// Header is one message header.
type Header struct {
	Key   string
	Value string
}

// Message is what the outbox relay publishes to a broker.
type Message struct {
	// Topic is the destination stream.
	Topic string
	// Key orders and partitions the message; nil lets the broker spread it.
	Key     []byte
	Value   []byte
	Headers []Header
}

// PublishResult is the outcome of publishing one message.
type PublishResult struct {
	// Err is nil when the broker acknowledged the message.
	Err error
	// Permanent means the broker will never accept this message as it is (it is too large, the topic name is invalid, ...),
	// as opposed to a failure that can go away (the broker is down, a timeout).
	Permanent bool
}

// EventPublisher publishes messages to a broker.
type EventPublisher interface {
	// Publish publishes the messages and returns one result per message, in the same order. Messages with the same key
	// reach the broker in the order given; once one of them fails, the ones after it fail too.
	Publish(ctx context.Context, messages []Message) []PublishResult
	// Ping reports whether the broker answers.
	Ping(ctx context.Context) error
	// Close releases the connection.
	Close()
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Write the message building**

Create `app/internal/application/outbox/message.go`:

```go
package outbox

import (
	"context"
	"sort"

	"github.com/sanctumlabs/curtz/app/internal/ports"
	"go.opentelemetry.io/otel/propagation"

)

const (
	headerTraceParent = "traceparent"
	headerTraceState  = "tracestate"
	contentTypeJSON   = "application/json"
)

// mapCarrier lets the W3C propagator read and write the trace headers of a stored event.
type mapCarrier map[string]string

func (c mapCarrier) Get(key string) string { return c[key] }
func (c mapCarrier) Set(key, value string) { c[key] = value }
func (c mapCarrier) Keys() []string {
	keys := make([]string, 0, len(c))
	for key := range c {
		keys = append(keys, key)
	}
	return keys
}

// storedTraceContext returns ctx carrying the trace context the writer stored with the event, so the publish span is
// a child of the request that wrote it. Without a stored context, or with a malformed one, ctx is returned unchanged.
func storedTraceContext(ctx context.Context, event ports.OutboxEvent) context.Context {
	return propagation.TraceContext{}.Extract(ctx, mapCarrier(event.Headers))
}

// buildMessage turns a claimed event into a broker message: the destination is the topic, the partition key the key, the
// payload the value untouched, and the stored headers are forwarded in key order plus a content type. The trace headers
// are the publish span's, so a consumer's span is a child of it; if there is no valid span (tracing is off) the stored
// ones are forwarded as they are.
func buildMessage(spanCtx context.Context, event ports.OutboxEvent) ports.Message {
	headers := make(map[string]string, len(event.Headers)+1)
	for key, value := range event.Headers {
		headers[key] = value
	}
	if trace.SpanContextFromContext(spanCtx).IsValid() {
		delete(headers, headerTraceParent)
		delete(headers, headerTraceState)
		propagation.TraceContext{}.Inject(spanCtx, mapCarrier(headers))
	}
	headers["content-type"] = contentTypeJSON

	keys := make([]string, 0, len(headers))
	for key := range headers {
		keys = append(keys, key)
	}
	sort.Strings(keys)
	list := make([]ports.Header, 0, len(keys))
	for _, key := range keys {
		list = append(list, ports.Header{Key: key, Value: headers[key]})
	}

	var key []byte
	if event.PartitionKey != "" {
		key = []byte(event.PartitionKey)
	}
	return ports.Message{Topic: event.Destination, Key: key, Value: event.Payload, Headers: list}
}
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the tests**

Run: `gofmt -l app/internal/ports app/internal/application/outbox; go vet ./app/internal/... && go test -race -count=1 ./app/internal/application/outbox`
Expected: no gofmt output; vet clean; `ok`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add app/internal/ports app/internal/application/outbox
git commit -m "feat(outbox): add the outbox and event bus ports and the message building"
```

### Task 4: The relay

**Files:**

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `gofmt -l app/internal/application/outbox; go vet ./app/internal/application/outbox && go test -race -count=1 ./app/internal/application/outbox`
Expected: no gofmt output; vet clean; `ok` (the log lines the relay writes during the tests are normal output).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add app/internal/application/outbox
git commit -m "feat(outbox): add the relay with leadership, parking, purge, spans and metrics"
```

### Task 5: The Postgres outbox adapter and its lease

**Files:**
- Create: `app/internal/adapters/postgres/outbox/doc.go`, `outbox_datastore_adapter.go`, `outbox_datastore_adapter_integration_test.go` (package `outboxdatastore`)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the sqlc functions of Task 1, `ports.OutboxDatastore` and `ports.Lease` (Task 3), `postgres.StringToUUID`/`UUIDToString`/`ConnectionString`.
- Produces: `outboxdatastore.NewAdapter(client database.PostgresDatabaseClient, connString string, timeout time.Duration) (*Adapter, error)` implementing `ports.OutboxDatastore`. `Acquire` opens a dedicated connection (parsed through `pgxpool.ParseConfig`, tracer off) and takes `pg_try_advisory_lock` on a key derived from `"curtz.outbox.relay"`; the lease's `Alive` runs `SELECT 1` on it and `Release` closes it. Every statement is bounded by `timeout`. Tasks 11 and 12 construct it.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing integration tests**

Create `app/internal/adapters/postgres/outbox/outbox_datastore_adapter_integration_test.go`. They run against a real Postgres with all migrations (claim order and per-destination limit, ties by id, skipping sent, parked and deleted rows, unreadable headers, empty key, mark sent once, invalid ids, rejection counting and parking and re-queueing, purge limits and what it never deletes, backlog, lease exclusivity and release, a lease whose backend is terminated, and the partial index serving the claim predicate):

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

### Task 6: The franz-go producer (needs the go-ahead)

**Files:**
- Modify: `go.mod`, `go.sum`, `app/test/vars.go`
- Create: `app/pkg/infra/queue/kafka/producer.go`, `producer_test.go`, `producer_integration_test.go`
- Create: `app/test/test_kafka.go`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: nothing from earlier tasks.
- Produces: `kafka.Config{Brokers []string, ClientID string, PublishTimeout time.Duration}`, `kafka.Record{Topic string, Key, Value []byte, Headers []kafka.Header}`, `kafka.Header{Key, Value string}`, `kafka.NewProducer(cfg Config, extra ...kgo.Opt) (*Producer, error)`, `(*Producer).Produce(ctx, []Record) []error` (one error per record in order, bounded by `PublishTimeout`), `Ping`, `Close`, `kafka.IsPermanent(err) bool`; the test helper `test.StartKafka(t) *test.KafkaBroker` with `Brokers`, `Stop`, `Start`, `CreateTopic`, `Consume`. Tasks 7, 11 and 12 use them.

- [ ] **Step 1: STOP and ask for the go-ahead**

Use AskUserQuestion. Say, in the question text: from here the plan needs franz-go, which is already in the local module cache together with its dependencies (`pkg/kmsg` v1.14.0, `github.com/pierrec/lz4/v4` v4.1.30, `github.com/klauspost/compress` v1.20.0), so adding it downloads nothing (it is run with `GOPROXY=off`, which proves it). Two things the user must decide: (1) adding franz-go raises the existing indirect requirement `github.com/klauspost/compress` from v1.18.6 to v1.20.0, a compression library that is part of the production binary (a minor-version bump, from the cache); (2) the later `go mod tidy` and the Docker image builds of Tasks 13 and 16 use the network (`go mod tidy` may fetch test-only dependencies of the new modules; the builder runs `go mod download` for every module, from `proxy.golang.org`, verified against `sum.golang.org`, a few tens of MB, the same modules as the local build plus franz-go). No Docker image is pulled: `apache/kafka:4.3.1` and `postgres:16.2-alpine` are already local. Options: "Go ahead (Recommended)" and "Not now". If it is no, stop here and report Tasks 1 to 5 as done. Do not run any command below that touches the network until the answer is yes.

- [ ] **Step 2: Add franz-go from the cache**

Run:

```bash
GOFLAGS=-mod=mod GOPROXY=off go get github.com/twmb/franz-go/pkg/kgo@v1.22.1
git diff go.mod | grep '^[+-]' | grep -v '^+++\|^---'
git diff --stat go.sum
```

Expected: `go get` prints `upgraded github.com/klauspost/compress v1.18.6 => v1.20.0`, `upgraded github.com/pierrec/lz4/v4 v4.1.16 => v4.1.30`, `added github.com/twmb/franz-go v1.22.1` and `added github.com/twmb/franz-go/pkg/kmsg v1.14.0`; `go.mod` gains those four lines (the first two new requirements are marked `// indirect` until code imports them: step 11's `go mod tidy` fixes that) and `go.sum` gains eight lines. Nothing else. If the command fails with `module lookup disabled by GOPROXY=off`, a module is missing from the cache: stop and ask instead of retrying with the network on.

- [ ] **Step 3: Write the failing unit tests**

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the unit tests**

Run: `gofmt -l app/pkg/infra/queue/kafka; go vet ./app/pkg/infra/queue/kafka && go test -race -count=1 ./app/pkg/infra/queue/kafka`
Expected: no gofmt output; `ok` (a producer for a broker that is down builds at once and its `Produce` fails every record with a transient error within the delivery timeout).

- [ ] **Step 7: Write the Kafka test broker**

Create `app/test/test_kafka.go`. It runs the local `apache/kafka:4.3.1` image like the stack's `kafka-single` (KRaft, topics not auto-created), on a free host port bound to the same port inside so the advertised address works, and can be stopped and started again on the same address:

```go
package test

	"context"
	"fmt"
	"net"
	"net/netip"
	"testing"

)

// KafkaBroker is a single-node Kafka (KRaft) running in a container, set up like the local stack's kafka-single: topics are
// not created automatically. It listens on a host port that stays the same when the broker is stopped and started again.
type KafkaBroker struct {
	// Brokers is the address to give a client.
	Brokers   []string
	container testcontainers.Container
}

// StartKafka starts a broker with the apache/kafka image the local stack uses and removes it when the test ends.
func StartKafka(t *testing.T) *KafkaBroker {
	t.Helper()
	ctx := context.Background()

	// The advertised address must be known before the broker starts, so a free host port is chosen first and bound to the same port inside.
	listener, err := net.Listen("tcp", "127.0.0.1:0")
	if err != nil {
		t.Fatalf("find a free port for kafka: %v", err)
	}

In `app/test/vars.go` add one line inside the `const (` block, directly after `TEST_POSTGRES_DATABASE_VERSION` (it is the image of the stack's Kafka, `deploy/kafka/compose.yml`; no comment line, which would make gofmt realign the whole block):

```go
	TEST_KAFKA_IMAGE = "apache/kafka:4.3.1"
```

then `gofmt -w app/test/vars.go`; `git diff app/test/vars.go` must show that one added line and nothing else.

- [ ] **Step 8: Write the integration tests**

Create `app/pkg/infra/queue/kafka/producer_integration_test.go` (keys, values and headers with per-key order and one partition per key; a record without a key; an oversized record that is permanent while the others in the batch arrive; a missing topic that is transient; and the outage in miniature: a batch fails as a whole while the broker is away, succeeds after it is back, and a reader sees every record once in order):

```

- [ ] **Step 9: Run them**

Run: `gofmt -l app/test; go vet -tags integration ./app/test ./app/pkg/infra/queue/kafka && go test -tags integration -count=1 -v -timeout 10m ./app/pkg/infra/queue/kafka 2>&1 | grep -E '^(--- |ok|FAIL|panic)'`
Expected: `--- PASS` for all five `TestProducer_*` tests (the outage test takes about 15 seconds) and `ok`.

- [ ] **Step 10: Mutation check: the outage test must bite**

Temporarily delete the line `kgo.AllowIdempotentProduceCancellation(),` from `NewProducer` and run, with a short cap:

Run: `go test -tags integration -count=1 -timeout 2m -run TestProducer_ABatchThatFailsDuringAnOutage ./app/pkg/infra/queue/kafka`
Expected: `panic: test timed out after 2m0s` with the test blocked in `Produce` after the broker was stopped (franz-go waits for the broker to return, ignoring the delivery timeout). Restore the line and re-run the test: `ok`. If the test passes without the line, it proves nothing: stop and fix it before going on.

- [ ] **Step 11: Tidy the module graph**

This is covered by the go-ahead of step 1. Run:

```bash
go mod tidy
git diff go.mod | grep '^[+-]' | grep -v '^+++\|^---'
go build ./... && go vet ./app/... && go vet -tags integration ./app/pkg/infra/queue/kafka ./app/test
```

Expected: `franz-go` and `kmsg` listed as direct requirements, `github.com/moby/moby/api` moved to the direct block (the test broker imports its types), `klauspost/compress` at v1.20.0, no other version changed except by being dropped. If tidy changes another requirement's version, stop and ask.

- [ ] **Step 12: Commit**

```bash
git add go.mod go.sum app/test app/pkg/infra/queue/kafka
git commit -m "feat(kafka): add the franz-go producer and a Kafka test broker"
```

### Task 7: The Kafka event publisher

**Files:**
- Create: `app/internal/adapters/kafka/event_publisher.go`, `errors.go`, `event_publisher_test.go` (package `kafkaadapter`)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `kafka.Producer`, `kafka.Record`, `kafka.IsPermanent` (Task 6), `ports.EventPublisher` (Task 3).
- Produces: `kafkaadapter.NewEventPublisher(p *kafka.Producer) *EventPublisher` implementing `ports.EventPublisher` (`Publish(ctx, []ports.Message) []ports.PublishResult`): messages map onto records field by field, each failure is classified on its own, a missing result is a transient failure. It also has `Ping(ctx) error` (the worker's readiness check) and `Close()`. Tasks 11 and 12 use it.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Create `app/internal/adapters/kafka/event_publisher_test.go`:

```go
package kafkaadapter

import (
	"context"
	"errors"
	"testing"

	"github.com/sanctumlabs/curtz/app/internal/ports"

func (f *fakeProducer) Close()                     { f.closed = true }

func TestPublish_MapsMessagesOntoRecords(t *testing.T) {
	fake := &fakeProducer{produce: func(r []kafka.Record) []error { return make([]error, len(r)) }}
	publisher := &EventPublisher{producer: fake}

	assert.Equal(t, []ports.PublishResult{{}, {}}, results)
}

func TestPublish_ClassifiesEachFailureOnItsOwn(t *testing.T) {
	transient := errors.New("broker not available")
	fake := &fakeProducer{produce: func([]kafka.Record) []error {
		return []error{nil, kerr.MessageTooLarge, transient, kerr.UnknownTopicOrPartition}
	}}
	publisher := &EventPublisher{producer: fake}

	results := publisher.Publish(context.Background(), make([]ports.Message, 4))

	require.Len(t, results, 4)
	assert.Equal(t, ports.PublishResult{}, results[0])
	assert.Equal(t, ports.PublishResult{Err: kerr.MessageTooLarge, Permanent: true}, results[1])
	assert.Equal(t, ports.PublishResult{Err: transient}, results[2])
	assert.False(t, results[3].Permanent, "an unknown topic may be created later")
	assert.Error(t, results[3].Err)
}

func TestPublish_AMissingResultIsATransientFailure(t *testing.T) {
	fake := &fakeProducer{produce: func([]kafka.Record) []error { return []error{nil} }}
	publisher := &EventPublisher{producer: fake}

	results := publisher.Publish(context.Background(), make([]ports.Message, 2))

	assert.NoError(t, results[0].Err)
	assert.Error(t, results[1].Err)
	assert.False(t, results[1].Permanent)
}

func TestPingAndCloseReachTheProducer(t *testing.T) {
	fake := &fakeProducer{}
	publisher := &EventPublisher{producer: fake}

	assert.NoError(t, publisher.Ping(context.Background()))
	publisher.Close()

	assert.True(t, fake.pinged)
	assert.True(t, fake.closed)
}
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run them to verify they fail**

Run: `go test ./app/internal/adapters/kafka`
Expected: build failure: no non-test Go files, `undefined: EventPublisher`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

Create `app/internal/adapters/kafka/errors.go`:

```go
package kafkaadapter

import "errors"

// errNoResult marks a message the producer returned no answer for; it is treated as a transient failure.
var errNoResult = errors.New("kafka: no result for the message")
```

Create `app/internal/adapters/kafka/event_publisher.go`:

```go
// Package kafkaadapter implements ports.EventPublisher on Kafka: it maps relay messages onto Kafka records and tells
// permanent failures from transient ones.
package kafkaadapter

import (
	"context"

	"github.com/sanctumlabs/curtz/app/internal/ports"
	"github.com/sanctumlabs/curtz/app/pkg/infra/queue/kafka"
)

// producer is the part of kafka.Producer the adapter uses.
type producer interface {
	Produce(ctx context.Context, records []kafka.Record) []error
	Ping(ctx context.Context) error
	Close()
}

var _ ports.EventPublisher = (*EventPublisher)(nil)

// EventPublisher publishes outbox messages to Kafka.
type EventPublisher struct {
	producer producer
}

// NewEventPublisher wraps a Kafka producer.
func NewEventPublisher(p *kafka.Producer) *EventPublisher { return &EventPublisher{producer: p} }

// Publish produces the messages and returns one result per message, in order. A message the broker will never accept as it
// is (too large, an invalid topic name, ...) is a permanent failure; anything else that goes wrong is transient.
func (e *EventPublisher) Publish(ctx context.Context, messages []ports.Message) []ports.PublishResult {
	records := make([]kafka.Record, len(messages))
	for i, message := range messages {
		headers := make([]kafka.Header, len(message.Headers))
		for j, header := range message.Headers {
			headers[j] = kafka.Header{Key: header.Key, Value: header.Value}
		}
		records[i] = kafka.Record{Topic: message.Topic, Key: message.Key, Value: message.Value, Headers: headers}
	}

	errs := e.producer.Produce(ctx, records)
	results := make([]ports.PublishResult, len(messages))
	for i := range results {
		switch {
		case i >= len(errs):
			results[i] = ports.PublishResult{Err: errNoResult}
		case errs[i] != nil:
			results[i] = ports.PublishResult{Err: errs[i], Permanent: kafka.IsPermanent(errs[i])}
		}
	}
	return results
}

// Ping reports whether a broker answers.
func (e *EventPublisher) Ping(ctx context.Context) error { return e.producer.Ping(ctx) }

// Close closes the producer.
func (e *EventPublisher) Close() { e.producer.Close() }
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `gofmt -l app/internal/adapters/kafka; go vet ./app/internal/adapters/kafka && go test -race -count=1 ./app/internal/adapters/kafka`
Expected: no gofmt output; `ok`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add app/internal/adapters/kafka
git commit -m "feat(kafka): add the EventPublisher adapter"
```

### Task 8: A service-name default and a shared telemetry start

**Files:**
- Modify: `app/pkg/infra/telemetry/log.go`, `log_test.go`, `setup.go`, `setup_test.go`
- Create: `app/pkg/infra/telemetry/start.go`, `start_test.go`
- Modify: `app/cmd/main.go`
- Delete: `app/cmd/telemetry_test.go` (its tests move to `start_test.go`)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `telemetry.Setup` (slice 4).
- Produces: `telemetry.DefaultServiceName = "curtz"`; `telemetry.ServiceName(fallback string) string`; `telemetry.Options.ServiceName`; `telemetry.Start(ctx, opts Options) (flush func())` (idempotent flush with its own 5 s deadline). Task 11's worker and the API's `main` use them.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

In `app/pkg/infra/telemetry/log_test.go` replace the whole of `TestServiceName` (the last function) with:

```go
func TestServiceName(t *testing.T) {
	t.Setenv("OTEL_SERVICE_NAME", "")
	assert.Equal(t, "curtz", ServiceName(DefaultServiceName), "an empty value counts as unset")
	assert.Equal(t, "curtz-worker", ServiceName("curtz-worker"))

	t.Setenv("OTEL_SERVICE_NAME", "  curtz-api ")
	assert.Equal(t, "curtz-api", ServiceName("curtz-worker"), "the variable wins over the fallback")
}
```

In `app/pkg/infra/telemetry/setup_test.go` insert, directly above `func TestSetup_DisabledInstallsNothing`:

```go
// The worker passes its own service name; the API passes none and keeps "curtz". The variable still wins over both.
func TestSetup_TheApplicationsServiceNameIsTheDefaultAndTheEnvironmentStillWins(t *testing.T) {
	for name, tc := range map[string]struct {
		env, option, want string
	}{
		"no option, no variable": {"", "", "curtz"},
		"option only":            {"", "curtz-worker", "curtz-worker"},
		"variable beats option":  {"billing", "curtz-worker", "billing"},
	} {
		t.Run(name, func(t *testing.T) {
			c, endpoint := startCollector(t)
			t.Setenv("OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT", endpoint)
			t.Setenv("OTEL_SERVICE_NAME", tc.env)
			t.Setenv("OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES", "")
			resetGlobals(t)

			shutdown, err := Setup(context.Background(), Options{ServiceName: tc.option})
			require.NoError(t, err)
			_, span := otel.Tracer("test").Start(context.Background(), "work")
			span.End()

- [ ] **Step 2: Run them to verify they fail**

Run: `go test ./app/pkg/infra/telemetry`
Expected: build failure `too many arguments in call to ServiceName`, `undefined: DefaultServiceName`, `unknown field ServiceName in struct literal of type Options`, `undefined: Start`, `undefined: setup`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

In `app/pkg/infra/telemetry/log.go` replace the `defaultServiceName` constant and `ServiceName` with:

```go
// DefaultServiceName is the service name of the API when OTEL_SERVICE_NAME is not set.
const DefaultServiceName = "curtz"

// ServiceName is the name this process reports: OTEL_SERVICE_NAME, or fallback when it is not set. The log lines and the
// telemetry resource both use it, so a log line and the trace it belongs to name the same service.
func ServiceName(fallback string) string {
	if name := strings.TrimSpace(os.Getenv("OTEL_SERVICE_NAME")); name != "" {
		return name
	}
	return fallback
}
```

In `app/pkg/infra/telemetry/setup.go`: add `"cmp"` to the imports (before `"context"`), add the field to `Options` as its first field:

```go
	// ServiceName is the service name when OTEL_SERVICE_NAME is not set; it defaults to DefaultServiceName.
	ServiceName string
```

and in `newResource` change `attribute.String("service.name", defaultServiceName)` to `attribute.String("service.name", cmp.Or(opts.ServiceName, DefaultServiceName))`.

Create `app/pkg/infra/telemetry/start.go`:

```go
package telemetry

import (
	"context"
	"log/slog"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

// flushTimeout bounds the final export of spans and metrics at shutdown.
const flushTimeout = 5 * time.Second

// setup is Setup. It is a variable so a test can replace it.
var setup = Setup

// Start installs the OpenTelemetry SDK and returns the function that flushes it. Call the flush once the server or the
// relay has stopped, so the last spans and the final metrics are exported; it flushes only once, however often it is
// called. Telemetry never stops the process: when the SDK cannot start the process runs without it, and a failing flush is
// only logged.
func Start(ctx context.Context, opts Options) (flush func()) {
	shutdown, err := setup(ctx, opts)
	if err != nil {
		slog.WarnContext(ctx, "telemetry is disabled: the OpenTelemetry SDK could not start", "error", err)
		return func() {}
	}
	var once sync.Once
	return func() {
		once.Do(func() {
			// ctx is already cancelled when this runs (that is what began the shutdown), so the flush gets its own deadline.
			flushCtx, cancel := context.WithTimeout(context.WithoutCancel(ctx), flushTimeout)
			defer cancel()
			if err := shutdown(flushCtx); err != nil {
				slog.WarnContext(flushCtx, "flushing telemetry", "error", err)
			}
		})
	}
}
```

In `app/cmd/main.go`:
- delete the constant `telemetryFlushTimeout` and its comment from the `const` block, the variable `setupTelemetry` with its comment, the whole function `startTelemetry` with its comment, and the import `"sync"`;
- change the logger line to `slog.SetDefault(telemetry.NewLogger(os.Stdout, cfg.Logging.Format, cfg.Logging.Level, telemetry.ServiceName(telemetry.DefaultServiceName)))`;
- in `run`, change `flushTelemetry := startTelemetry(ctx, cfg)` to `flushTelemetry := telemetry.Start(ctx, telemetry.Options{ServiceVersion: pkg.Version, Environment: cfg.Environment})`;
- run `gofmt -w app/cmd/main.go` (it removes the blank line left in the `const` block).

```bash
git rm app/cmd/telemetry_test.go
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `gofmt -l app/cmd app/pkg/infra/telemetry; go vet ./app/cmd ./app/pkg/infra/telemetry && go test -race -count=1 ./app/pkg/infra/telemetry ./app/cmd`
Expected: no gofmt output; both `ok`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add app/cmd app/pkg/infra/telemetry
git commit -m "refactor(telemetry): share the start and flush helper and let a process name its own service"
```

### Task 9: The worker's configuration

**Files:**
- Create: `app/config/worker.go`, `worker_test.go`
- Modify: `.env.example`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `config.LoadDatabase`, `LoadLogging`, the reader helpers (`splitList`, `validAddress`).
- Produces: `config.HealthSettings{Host string; Port int}`, `config.KafkaSettings`, `config.OutboxSettings`, `config.Worker`, and `LoadWorker`, `LoadWorkerHealth`, `LoadKafka`, `LoadOutbox` (all strict, every problem reported at once, values never echoed). Task 11 reads them.

```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run them to verify they fail**

Run: `go test ./app/config`
Expected: build failure `undefined: LoadWorker`, `undefined: HealthSettings`, `undefined: KafkaSettings` and the other new names.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

Create `app/config/worker.go`:

```go
package config

type KafkaSettings struct {
	// Brokers are the seed brokers, as host:port.

- [ ] **Step 4: Document the variables in `.env.example`**

In `.env.example` insert this block, followed by one blank line, directly above the line `# --- Local infrastructure (docker compose, ...` (the value allowlist of `scripts/infra_env_check.sh` starts at that line, and `localhost:19092` must stay above it):

```bash
# Outbox relay worker (app/cmd/worker, make infra.worker.up): delivers outbox_events to Kafka. From the host the single
# broker is localhost:19092; HA also has localhost:29092 and localhost:39092. Times are in the unit the name or the
# comment gives; OUTBOX_RETENTION_DAYS=0 turns the purge of sent events off.
KAFKA_BROKERS=localhost:19092
KAFKA_CLIENT_ID=curtz-worker
KAFKA_PUBLISH_TIMEOUT=10
OUTBOX_POLL_INTERVAL_MS=100
OUTBOX_BATCH_SIZE=100
OUTBOX_MAX_ATTEMPTS=3
OUTBOX_STANDBY_INTERVAL=5
OUTBOX_RETENTION_DAYS=7
WORKER_HTTP_PORT=8086
```

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the tests and the env check**

Run: `gofmt -l app/config/worker.go app/config/worker_test.go; go test -race -count=1 ./app/config && bash scripts/infra_env_check.sh && echo env-check-ok`
Expected: no gofmt output (`app/config/database.go` is old and not listed here); `ok`; `env-check-ok`. `TestLoadWorker_EnvExampleDocumentsTheDefaults` keeps the block pinned to the loader's defaults from now on.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add app/config .env.example
git commit -m "feat(worker): add the worker configuration and document its variables"
```

### Task 10: The worker's health handler

**Files:**
- Create: `app/api/probes/http_handler.go`, `app/api/probes/http_handler_test.go`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `health.Registry` (`Run`, `Report.Ready`, `SetDraining`), the existing `probes.LivePath` and `probes.ReadyPath`.
- Produces: `probes.NewHTTPHandler(registry *health.Registry, alive func() bool) http.Handler`: `GET /health` answers 200 `{"status":"ok"}` while `alive()` is true and 503 `{"status":"stalled"}` when it is not; `GET /health/ready` answers the registry's report with the status the API's router gives it (200, or 503 when a required check fails or the process is draining); any other path or method is not served. Task 11 mounts it.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Create `app/api/probes/http_handler_test.go` (liveness follows the loop and ignores the dependencies, readiness reports each dependency like the API does, draining is 503, and nothing but the two GET probes is served):

	body, err := io.ReadAll(recorder.Result().Body)
	require.NoError(t, err)
	return recorder.Code, string(body)
}

func workerRegistry(postgres, kafka error) *health.Registry {
	registry := health.NewRegistry(time.Second)
	registry.Add(health.Check{Name: "postgres", Required: true, Fn: func(context.Context) error { return postgres }})
	registry.Add(health.Check{Name: "kafka", Required: true, Fn: func(context.Context) error { return kafka }})
	return registry
}

func TestHTTPHandler_LivenessFollowsTheLoopNotTheDependencies(t *testing.T) {

- [ ] **Step 2: Run them to verify they fail**

Run: `go test ./app/api/probes`
Expected: build failure `undefined: NewHTTPHandler`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

Create `app/api/probes/http_handler.go`:

```go
package probes

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"net/http"

	"github.com/sanctumlabs/curtz/app/pkg/infra/monitoring/health"
)

// NewHTTPHandler serves the same two probes as NewRouter over net/http, for processes that have no Fiber app (the outbox
// worker). Liveness answers 200 while alive returns true and 503 when it does not, which is how a wedged loop gets a
// container restarted; readiness answers the registry's report exactly as the API does.
func NewHTTPHandler(registry *health.Registry, alive func() bool) http.Handler {
	mux := http.NewServeMux()
	mux.HandleFunc("GET "+LivePath, func(w http.ResponseWriter, _ *http.Request) {
		if alive() {
			writeJSON(w, http.StatusOK, map[string]string{"status": "ok"})
			return
		}
		writeJSON(w, http.StatusServiceUnavailable, map[string]string{"status": "stalled"})
	})
	mux.HandleFunc("GET "+ReadyPath, func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		report := registry.Run(r.Context())
		status := http.StatusOK
		if !report.Ready() {
			status = http.StatusServiceUnavailable
		}
		writeJSON(w, status, report)
	})
	return mux
}

func writeJSON(w http.ResponseWriter, status int, body any) {
	w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
	w.WriteHeader(status)
	_ = json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(body)
}
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `gofmt -l app/api/probes; go vet ./app/api/probes && go test -race -count=1 ./app/api/probes`
Expected: no gofmt output; `ok` (the API's `router_test.go` tests still pass beside the new ones).

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add app/api/probes
git commit -m "feat(probes): add a net/http handler for the worker's liveness and readiness"
```

### Task 11: The worker command

**Files:**
- Create: `app/cmd/worker/main.go`, `app/cmd/worker/main_test.go`, `app/cmd/worker/main_integration_test.go`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `config.LoadWorker`, `config.LoadWorkerHealth` (Task 9), `telemetry.Start`, `telemetry.ServiceName`, `telemetry.NewLogger` (Task 8), `probes.NewHTTPHandler` (Task 10), `outbox.NewRelay`, `outbox.Config`, `(*Relay).Run`, `(*Relay).Healthy` (Task 4), `outboxdatastore.NewAdapter` (Task 5), `kafka.NewProducer`, `kafkaadapter.NewEventPublisher`, `(*EventPublisher).Ping`/`Close` (Tasks 6 and 7), `postgres.NewPostgresClient`, `postgres.ConnectionString`.
- Produces: the `worker` binary: `worker` runs the relay, `worker healthcheck` probes `/health` on the configured port and exits 0 or 1. `run(ctx, cfg config.Worker) error` (the testable core), `relayConfig(config.OutboxSettings) outbox.Config` and `healthcheck(lookup, out) int`. The image, compose stack and live drill (Tasks 13 to 16) run it.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing unit tests**

Create `app/cmd/worker/main_test.go` (run fails fast and clearly when Postgres is unreachable, the settings map onto the relay's configuration while the relay's own pacing stays fixed, and the healthcheck subcommand: alive, stalled, nothing listening, needing only the health settings, a wildcard bind and a bad port, and giving up after its timeout):

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `gofmt -l app/cmd/worker; go vet ./app/cmd/worker && go vet -tags integration ./app/cmd/worker && go test -race -count=1 ./app/cmd/worker`
Expected: no gofmt output; `ok`.

Run: `go test -tags integration -count=1 -v -timeout 10m ./app/cmd/worker 2>&1 | grep -E '^(--- |ok|FAIL|panic)'`
Expected: `--- PASS: TestRun_RelaysAWaitingEventAnswersItsProbesAndStopsCleanly` and `ok` (Postgres and Kafka containers, about 30 seconds).

- [ ] **Step 5: Smoke the binary's refusal**

Run: `go build -o /tmp/curtz-worker-smoke ./app/cmd/worker && ENVIRONMENT=production /tmp/curtz-worker-smoke; echo "exit=$?"`

Expected: one JSON log line `"msg":"invalid configuration"` whose error names `DATABASE_PASSWORD` (the development password is refused in production) and `exit=1`. No Kafka or Postgres is contacted. Then remove the binary by its literal path: `rm /tmp/curtz-worker-smoke`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add app/cmd/worker
git commit -m "feat(worker): add the worker command that runs the outbox relay"
```

### Task 12: The relay end to end against Postgres and Kafka

**Files:**
- Create: `app/internal/application/outbox/relay_integration_test.go` (tag `integration`, package `outbox_test`)

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: everything built so far (the real writer from Task 2, the Postgres adapter, the Kafka adapter and producer, the relay, the Postgres and Kafka test helpers).
- Produces: five end-to-end tests that pin the spec's success criteria 1 to 6 with real services; no production code.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the tests**

Create `app/internal/application/outbox/relay_integration_test.go`. A written event arrives once with its key, headers and the trace of the request that wrote it (and the row is marked sent); a Kafka outage leaves the events waiting and they arrive in order when Kafka returns, with nothing parked; an event Kafka rejects permanently is parked after the configured attempts while the others still flow; of two relays one publishes and the other takes over when it stops; and the purge deletes old sent rows and nothing else:

- [ ] **Step 2: Run them**

Run: `gofmt -l app/internal/application/outbox; go vet -tags integration ./app/internal/application/outbox && go test -tags integration -count=1 -v -timeout 15m ./app/internal/application/outbox 2>&1 | grep -E '^(--- |ok|FAIL|panic)'`
Expected: no gofmt output; five `--- PASS: TestRelay_*` lines (the outage and takeover tests take the longest, about a minute each) and `ok`. These tests pass on first run because Tasks 4 to 7 built everything they need: a failure here is a real defect in an earlier task, not a missing piece. Fix it in the owning task's file and add the unit or adapter test that would have caught it, test-first.

- [ ] **Step 3: Mutation check: the ordering and parking tests must bite**

Temporarily change the outer `ORDER BY ranked.created_at, ranked.id` of `QueryClaimOutboxEvents` (in the generated `app/internal/adapters/postgres/sql/outbox_relay_queries.sql.go`, only in the working tree; the first of the two occurrences, the SQL constant, not the comment) to `ORDER BY ranked.created_at DESC, ranked.id DESC` and run `go test -tags integration -count=1 -run 'TestRelay_DrainsTheBacklogInOrder' ./app/internal/application/outbox`. Expected: FAIL (the records arrive in reverse order). Restore it with `git checkout app/internal/adapters/postgres/sql/outbox_relay_queries.sql.go` and re-run: `ok`. If the test passes with the order reversed it proves nothing: stop and fix it.

- [ ] **Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add app/internal/application/outbox/relay_integration_test.go
git commit -m "test(outbox): pin the relay's delivery, outage, parking, failover and purge against Postgres and Kafka"
```

### Task 13: The image, the compose stack and the make target

**Files:**
- Modify: `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `scripts/infra.sh`, `scripts/infra_test.sh`, `scripts/image_test.sh`, `.make/docker.mk`
- Create: `deploy/worker/compose.yml`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the `app/cmd/worker` binary (Task 11).
- Produces: `/app/worker` in the image (same `curtz` image as the API, `curtz-app:local` in compose); the compose services `worker-ha` and `worker-single` (host port `127.0.0.1:8086`, health check `/app/worker healthcheck`); `scripts/infra.sh up|down|wait worker [ha|single]`; `make infra.worker.up|down [MODE=ha|single]`. Tasks 15 and 16 document and run them.

`make infra.*` targets run `create.envfile`, which only creates `.env` when it does not exist and never changes an existing one.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing checks**

In `scripts/infra_test.sh` insert the three worker cases after the `wait resolves the app profile` case (the `up` case pins the whole command sequence: Postgres, then Kafka, then the worker, built):

In `scripts/image_test.sh` add the worker file to the context check and two image checks (the worker is present and refuses the development password in production; its healthcheck runs read-only without capabilities and fails when nothing listens):

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the infra checks to verify they fail**

Run: `bash scripts/infra_test.sh 2>&1 | grep -E '^(FAIL|all tests|[0-9]+ )' ; echo "exit=${PIPESTATUS[0]}"`
Expected: `FAIL` lines for the three worker cases (the stack name is unknown to `infra.sh`) and a non-zero exit. The image checks need an image and are run in step 7.

- [ ] **Step 3: Teach `scripts/infra.sh` and the Makefile the worker stack**

In `scripts/infra.sh` make these edits (the worker stack brings up Postgres and Kafka first, because the worker reads Postgres and writes to Kafka, and is built like the API):

### Task 14: Alert rules and the worker dashboard

**Files:**
- Modify: `deploy/observability/prometheus/rules/stack.yml`, `deploy/observability/prometheus/tests/stack_test.yml`
- Create: `deploy/observability/grafana/dashboards/curtz-worker.json`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the relay's metrics (Task 4), predicted in Prometheus form: `outbox_relay_oldest_unsent_age_seconds`, `outbox_relay_parked_rows`, `outbox_relay_backlog`, `outbox_relay_leader`, `outbox_relay_published_total`, `outbox_relay_failures_total`, `outbox_relay_publish_duration_seconds_*`, labelled `service_name="curtz-worker"`.
- Produces: the alerts `OutboxBacklogOld` and `OutboxEventsParked`, and the dashboard `curtz-worker` (folder Curtz). Task 16 confirms the metric names on the running stack and corrects the queries here if they differ.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing unit tests of the rules**

Append to `deploy/observability/prometheus/tests/stack_test.yml` (a backlog older than five minutes fires, a young one does not, no worker series raises neither alert, parked rows fire and zero parked does not):

```yaml
  - name: The oldest outbox event has been waiting for more than five minutes
    interval: 1m
    input_series:
      - {series: 'outbox_relay_oldest_unsent_age_seconds{service_name="curtz-worker"}', values: "301 400 500 600 700"}
    alert_rule_test:
      - eval_time: 4m
        alertname: OutboxBacklogOld
        exp_alerts:
          - exp_labels: {severity: warning}
            exp_annotations: {summary: The oldest outbox event has been waiting for delivery for more than 5 minutes}

  - name: A backlog that is only a minute old is not an alert
    interval: 1m
    input_series:
      - {series: 'outbox_relay_oldest_unsent_age_seconds{service_name="curtz-worker"}', values: "60 60 60 60 60"}
    alert_rule_test:
      - eval_time: 4m
        alertname: OutboxBacklogOld
        exp_alerts: []

  - name: No worker series at all, so neither outbox alert
    interval: 1m
    input_series:
      - {series: 'up{job="prometheus"}', values: "1 1 1 1 1 1 1"}
    alert_rule_test:
      - eval_time: 6m
        alertname: OutboxBacklogOld
        exp_alerts: []
      - eval_time: 6m
        alertname: OutboxEventsParked
        exp_alerts: []

  - name: Parked outbox events
    interval: 1m
    input_series:
      - {series: 'outbox_relay_parked_rows{service_name="curtz-worker"}', values: "1 1 1 1 1 1 1"}
    alert_rule_test:
      - eval_time: 6m
        alertname: OutboxEventsParked
        exp_alerts:
          - exp_labels: {severity: warning}
            exp_annotations: {summary: The outbox relay gave up on events; fix the cause and re-queue them (docs/LocalInfrastructure.md)}

  - name: Nothing parked, so no alert
    interval: 1m
    input_series:
      - {series: 'outbox_relay_parked_rows{service_name="curtz-worker"}', values: "0 0 0 0 0 0 0"}
    alert_rule_test:
      - eval_time: 6m
        alertname: OutboxEventsParked
        exp_alerts: []
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run them to verify they fail**

Run: `docker run --rm --entrypoint promtool -v "$PWD/deploy/observability/prometheus:/p:ro" prom/prometheus:v3.15.0 test rules /p/tests/stack_test.yml 2>&1 | grep -E 'FAILED|SUCCESS'`
Expected: `FAILED` (the two firing cases expect alerts that no rule defines yet). The image is the one the slice 1 plan already used and is local.

- [ ] **Step 3: Add the rules**

Append to the `rules:` list of `deploy/observability/prometheus/rules/stack.yml`:

```diff

Expected: `SUCCESS: 7 rules found`, then `SUCCESS`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Mutation check: the firing test must bite**

Temporarily change `> 300` to `> 3000` in the `OutboxBacklogOld` expression and run the `test rules` command again: Expected `FAILED` with `got:[]`. Restore `> 300` and re-run: `SUCCESS`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Add the dashboard**

Create `deploy/observability/grafana/dashboards/curtz-worker.json` (nine panels: active relays, waiting events, oldest waiting event, parked events, events published per second by destination, failures per second by kind, publish duration p50 and p99, backlog and its oldest age over time, and the leader per instance). Grafana's file provisioning picks it up from this folder, like the two existing dashboards:

### Task 15: Documentation, ADR-0018 and the ADR-0011 update

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/LocalInfrastructure.md`, `docs/Deployment.md`, `docs/adr/0011-single-broker-agnostic-outbox.md`, `docs/adr/0017-the-api-exports-telemetry-over-otlp-and-keeps-logs-on-stdout.md`
- Create: `docs/adr/0018-the-outbox-relay-is-one-leader-elected-polling-worker-over-franz-go.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the behaviour built in Tasks 1 to 14.
- Produces: the documentation the spec's success criterion 8 asks for. No code.

Everything written here must match the code: the variable names and defaults are those of `.env.example` (Task 9), the metric names are corrected in Task 16 if the running stack shows different ones (then correct this text too).

- [ ] **Step 1: Write ADR-0018**

Create `docs/adr/0018-the-outbox-relay-is-one-leader-elected-polling-worker-over-franz-go.md`:

````markdown
---
status: accepted

# The outbox relay is one leader-elected polling worker over franz-go, delivering at least once and parking events Kafka rejects for good

Domain events reach Kafka through a separate process, `worker` (`app/cmd/worker`, `/app/worker` in the image). The API never talks to Kafka (ADR-0015); it only writes `outbox_events` in the aggregate's transaction (ADR-0011).

**One active relay.** Workers compete for a Postgres advisory lock (`pg_try_advisory_lock`) held on a dedicated connection; the holder relays, the others stand by and retry every `OUTBOX_STANDBY_INTERVAL` seconds, and the lock is freed when the holder's connection goes away, so a crashed leader is replaced without any coordination service. One relay publishing in `(created_at, id)` order is what keeps one aggregate's events in order, and the outbox's volume (registrations and URL creations, not redirects) does not need parallel relays.

**Polling.** Every `OUTBOX_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` (default 100) the relay claims up to `OUTBOX_BATCH_SIZE` unsent, unparked rows per destination, publishes them in one call and marks the acknowledged ones sent. Per destination, so a destination whose topic is missing cannot starve the others. There is no `LISTEN/NOTIFY` and no `FOR UPDATE`: the lock already makes the relay the only reader, and the partial index on unsent rows makes the poll cheap.

**At least once.** The relay can stop between a publish and the update of `sent_time`, and a producer that gives up on a record in flight cannot know whether the broker stored it, so an event can be delivered twice. Consumers de-duplicate on the `event_id` header (the outbox row's UUIDv7). Exactly-once would need Kafka transactions spanning two systems.

**Failures are two different things.** A transient failure (Kafka down, a timeout, an unknown topic, anything not on the allowlist) never counts against an event and never parks one: the rows stay, the relay backs off from 200 ms to 10 s and the backlog alert says so. A permanent rejection, an explicit allowlist of broker answers that never change for the same record (`MESSAGE_TOO_LARGE`, `RECORD_LIST_TOO_LARGE`, `INVALID_TOPIC_EXCEPTION`, `INVALID_RECORD`, `UNSUPPORTED_FOR_MESSAGE_FORMAT`, `TOPIC_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED`, `CLUSTER_AUTHORIZATION_FAILED`), increments `attempts`; at `OUTBOX_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (default 3) the row is parked (`parked_at`, `error_message`) and the relay carries on. A parked row stays in the table until someone fixes the cause and clears `parked_at` and `attempts`; there is no dead-letter topic.

**The client is franz-go.** It is pure Go, so it builds with `CGO_ENABLED=0` into the distroless image (a librdkafka client would need cgo), it has an idempotent producer with per-record results, and it keeps a partition's records in order when one fails. Every `Produce` call is bounded by `KAFKA_PUBLISH_TIMEOUT` and the client allows cancelling in-flight records (`AllowIdempotentProduceCancellation`): by default franz-go will not fail a record whose request is already on its way, so a broker that dies mid-request would keep the relay, and its shutdown, waiting until the broker returned. The price is a possible duplicate, which at-least-once delivery already allows.

**Layering.** The franz-go wrapper is infrastructure (`pkg/infra/queue/kafka`), the port is `ports.EventPublisher` and its adapter `internal/adapters/kafka`; the relay is a use case (`internal/application/outbox`) behind `ports.OutboxDatastore`, whose adapter is `internal/adapters/postgres/outbox`.

**Traces continue through the outbox.** The writer stores `traceparent` and `tracestate` (never baggage, which can carry user data) in `outbox_events.headers`; the relay starts an `outbox.publish` span per record as a child of that context and sends that span's `traceparent` in the Kafka record, so one trace ID runs from the HTTP request to the consumer. The relay's own queries run under `telemetry.Unsampled`, otherwise a poll every 100 ms would start ten traces a second. The worker's service name is `curtz-worker`, so the API's dashboards and alerts stay about the API.

**Sent rows are purged.** The leader deletes rows sent more than `OUTBOX_RETENTION_DAYS` ago (default 7, `0` keeps them), in batches; unsent and parked rows are never deleted.

## Considered options

- **A librdkafka-based client** (`confluent-kafka-go`) — the most widely used, but it needs cgo, which the static distroless image does not have.
- **Several relays claiming rows with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`** — more throughput and no failover wait, but events of one aggregate could be published out of order, and nothing here needs the throughput.
- **`LISTEN/NOTIFY` or change-data-capture instead of polling** — lower latency, but a second moving part (a lost notification still needs the poll as a safety net, CDC needs Debezium and Kafka Connect) to save latency nobody needs.
- **A dead-letter topic for rejected events** — it moves the problem to another place nobody watches; a parked row, a gauge and an alert keep it where the fix (and the original payload) is.
- **Delaying publication a little to follow commit order** — `created_at` is the transaction's start time, so a transaction that started earlier and committed later can be published after a later-started one. A visibility lag would narrow that window and cost latency on every event; each event carries `occurred_at` and a consumer that needs strict order sorts by it.

## Consequences

- Consumers must be idempotent on `event_id`.
- Order is per `partition_key` (the aggregate ID) and follows `(created_at, id)`, not commit order. For one aggregate the difference needs two concurrent writers, which the aggregate's row lock normally serializes; across aggregates no order is promised.
- If one partition's leader is unavailable and more than `OUTBOX_BATCH_SIZE` of a destination's oldest unsent rows belong to it, other keys of that destination wait until it recovers; the backlog alert shows it.
- The worker needs Postgres and Kafka; it never migrates (ADR-0014) and never creates topics (the stack's `kafka-init` does).
- A second worker is a standby, not extra capacity.
- There is no consumer yet; the first one (Analytics, cache invalidation) brings its own decisions.
````

- [ ] **Step 2: Update ADR-0011 and ADR-0017**

In `docs/adr/0011-single-broker-agnostic-outbox.md`, in the list of what each row stores, change the `headers` bullet to:

```markdown
- `headers`: `event_id`, `event_type`, `aggregate_id`, `occurred_at` and, when the request had a trace, `traceparent` (and `tracestate`), for the relay to forward as message headers.
```

and replace the consequence bullet `No relay exists yet, so rows accumulate unsent (...)` with:

```markdown
- The outbox relay (ADR-0018) delivers the rows to Kafka and records `sent_time`; a row the broker permanently rejects is parked (`parked_at`). The URL context adopts the same helper when its application layer lands.
```

In `docs/adr/0017-the-api-exports-telemetry-over-otlp-and-keeps-logs-on-stdout.md` change the last consequence bullet to end `... belong to the outbox relay slice (ADR-0018).` (only the last words change).

- [ ] **Step 3: Document the relay in `docs/LocalInfrastructure.md`**

Make these edits.

(a) In the `## Modes and profiles` table add a row after `Everything except legacy`:

```markdown
| Outbox relay worker (needs Postgres and Kafka) | `worker-ha` | `worker-single` | `infra.worker.up` |
```

(b) In the `## Make commands` table, in the first row, append ` worker` to the stack list (`... core full app worker`).

(c) Insert this section between `## The app in a container` and `## Observing the app`:

````markdown
## Relaying events to Kafka

The outbox relay is a second process, `worker`, built into the same image. It reads `outbox_events` from Postgres and publishes each row to the Kafka topic named by its `destination` (`identity.events`), keyed by `partition_key` so one aggregate's events stay in order. The API never talks to Kafka.

```bash
make infra.worker.up MODE=single   # or HA; brings up Postgres and Kafka for that mode first, then builds and starts the worker
curl -s localhost:8086/health/ready
make infra.worker.down             # stops only the worker; Postgres and Kafka keep running
```

- It listens on `127.0.0.1:8086` (`GET /health`, `GET /health/ready`). Its environment is an explicit list in `deploy/worker/compose.yml` (not your `.env`), it runs with `ENVIRONMENT=development`, a read-only filesystem and no capabilities, and its health check is `/app/worker healthcheck`.
- One worker is active at a time: they compete for a Postgres advisory lock and the others stand by, taking over within `OUTBOX_STANDBY_INTERVAL` seconds (default 5) after the active one stops. To try a failover, run a second worker on your host with `WORKER_HTTP_PORT=8087 go run ./app/cmd/worker` (the defaults reach `localhost:19092` and `localhost:5432`; in HA mode also set `KAFKA_BROKERS=localhost:19092,localhost:29092,localhost:39092`).
- Read what it published, headers included (`event_id`, `event_type`, `aggregate_id`, `occurred_at`, and `traceparent` when the request had a trace), or look at the topic in Kafka UI (<http://localhost:8080>):

```bash
docker compose --profile kafka-single exec kafka-single /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh \
  --bootstrap-server kafka-1:9092 --topic identity.events --from-beginning --timeout-ms 5000 \
  --property print.key=true --property print.headers=true
```

  In HA mode use `--profile kafka-ha exec kafka-1`.
- Delivery is **at least once**: a worker killed between a publish and recording it can publish the event again, so a consumer de-duplicates on the `event_id` header. Order is per `partition_key`.
- **Kafka down:** nothing is lost and nothing is parked. Events wait in the table, the worker backs off (200 ms up to 10 s) and `OutboxBacklogOld` fires when the oldest has waited more than five minutes; when Kafka returns they are published in order.
- **Parked events:** a record Kafka permanently refuses (for example one larger than the broker accepts) is retried until `OUTBOX_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (default 3) and then parked: `parked_at` and `error_message` are set, the rest keep flowing, and `OutboxEventsParked` fires after five minutes. Look at them and, once the cause is fixed, put one back:

```bash
make infra.psql MODE=single
```

```sql
SELECT id, destination, event_type, attempts, error_message, parked_at FROM outbox_events WHERE parked_at IS NOT NULL;
UPDATE outbox_events SET parked_at = NULL, attempts = 0, error_message = NULL WHERE id = '<id>';
```

- **Purge:** the active worker deletes rows sent more than `OUTBOX_RETENTION_DAYS` ago (default 7; `0` keeps them) when it starts and every ten minutes. Unsent and parked rows are never deleted.
- **Observing it:** the "Curtz worker" dashboard (folder Curtz) and the traces: each published event is a span `<destination> publish` of the service `curtz-worker`, a child of the request that wrote the event, so a registration's trace ends in the Kafka record's `traceparent`. Metrics are `outbox_relay_*` (published, failures, publish duration, backlog, oldest unsent age, parked rows, leader).
- Settings (all in `.env.example`): `KAFKA_BROKERS`, `KAFKA_CLIENT_ID`, `KAFKA_PUBLISH_TIMEOUT`, `OUTBOX_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`, `OUTBOX_BATCH_SIZE`, `OUTBOX_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, `OUTBOX_STANDBY_INTERVAL`, `OUTBOX_RETENTION_DAYS` and `WORKER_HTTP_PORT`.
````

(d) In `## Credentials and ports` add a row after the `Kafka UI` row:

```markdown
| Worker health | `localhost:8086` (`/health`, `/health/ready`) | none |
```

(e) In `## Failure drills (HA)` add a row after the Kafka row:

```markdown
| Outbox relay | stop the worker (`make infra.worker.down`) while a second one runs on your host | the second worker becomes the relay within `OUTBOX_STANDBY_INTERVAL` seconds; no event is lost (a duplicate carries the same `event_id`) |
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Document the worker in `docs/Deployment.md`**

(a) In `## Configuration`, in the sentence `In that mode the API and the migrator refuse the development secrets`, change `the API and the migrator` to `the API, the migrator and the worker`.

(b) Add this section after `## Running` (before `## Continuous integration`):

````markdown
## The outbox relay worker

The image also contains `/app/worker`, which delivers the transactional outbox to Kafka. Run it as its own container from the same image, after the migrator and with the same database settings as the API (it never migrates):

```bash
docker run -p 8086:8086 -e DATABASE_HOST=... -e DATABASE_NAME=... -e DATABASE_USERNAME=... -e DATABASE_PASSWORD=... -e KAFKA_BROKERS=... \
  --entrypoint /app/worker --name curtz-worker <IMAGE_NAME>:<IMAGE_TAG>
```

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `KAFKA_BROKERS` | `localhost:19092` | comma-separated `host:port` list; set it |
| `KAFKA_CLIENT_ID` | `curtz-worker` | |
| `KAFKA_PUBLISH_TIMEOUT` | `10` | seconds a record may take to be acknowledged before it counts as a transient failure |
| `OUTBOX_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | `100` | milliseconds between cycles when nothing was claimed (at least 10) |
| `OUTBOX_BATCH_SIZE` | `100` | rows claimed per destination per cycle (1 to 1000) |
| `OUTBOX_MAX_ATTEMPTS` | `3` | permanent rejections before an event is parked (at least 1) |
| `OUTBOX_STANDBY_INTERVAL` | `5` | seconds between a standby's attempts to become the active relay |
| `OUTBOX_RETENTION_DAYS` | `7` | days sent rows are kept; `0` keeps them forever |
| `WORKER_HTTP_PORT` | `8086` | the health listener |

The database, logging and telemetry variables are the API's; the worker's service name defaults to `curtz-worker`.

- Run more than one for failover: one is active (it holds a Postgres advisory lock), the others stand by. A second worker is not extra capacity.
- The topics must exist (the relay does not create them); an event for a missing topic waits and shows in the backlog alert.
- `GET /health` is liveness: 503 when the relay loop has not completed a cycle or a standby attempt for 30 seconds, so a wedged worker is restarted. `GET /health/ready` is 503 when Postgres or Kafka is down or the worker is draining; neither is a reason to restart. The container's health check is `/app/worker healthcheck`.
- On SIGTERM the worker finishes the batch it has in flight (bounded by `KAFKA_PUBLISH_TIMEOUT` and `SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT`), releases the lock, exports its last telemetry and exits 0. Give it the same stop grace period as the API (25 seconds locally).
- Delivery is at least once: consumers must de-duplicate on the `event_id` header. See ADR-0018 and the operations notes in `docs/LocalInfrastructure.md` (parked events, purge, failure behaviour).
````

- [ ] **Step 5: Check the documentation**

Run: `grep -c 'worker' docs/LocalInfrastructure.md docs/Deployment.md; grep -n 'No relay exists yet' docs/adr/0011-single-broker-agnostic-outbox.md; ls docs/adr | tail -2`
Expected: both docs list matches, no output from the `No relay exists yet` search, and `0018-the-outbox-relay-is-one-leader-elected-polling-worker-over-franz-go.md` is the last file.

Run: `bash scripts/infra_env_check.sh && echo env-check-ok`
Expected: `env-check-ok`.

Read the new section once as a reader who has not seen the code: every command must run as written (the `kafka-console-consumer.sh` path is checked in Task 16).

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add docs
git commit -m "docs: document the outbox relay and record ADR-0018"
```

---

### Task 16: The live drill and the final checks

**Files:** none are planned; fix what the drill finds in the owning task's files, test-first, and say so in the ledger.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: the whole branch.
- Produces: evidence for the spec's success criteria 1 to 7 on a running stack, and the confirmed Prometheus metric names.

This task runs real stacks. Before starting: `docker info` (start Docker Desktop if it is not running), `docker ps` (the developer's own containers must not be disturbed, and nothing here may stop them), and do not touch `.env` or `/etc/hosts`. Drill rows are tagged `event_type = 'drill.event'` and removed at the end. The go-ahead of Task 6 covers the image builds.

- [ ] **Step 1: Start the stacks**

Run, in this order:

```bash
make infra.observability.up
make infra.worker.up MODE=single
make infra.app.up MODE=single
docker compose --profile worker-single ps worker-single
curl -s localhost:8086/health/ready; echo; curl -s localhost:8085/health/ready; echo
```

Expected: the worker container is `healthy`; both ready calls answer `{"status":"ok",...}` with `postgres` and `kafka` (worker) or `postgres` and `redis` (API) up. If the machine's memory allows, also `make infra.elk.up MODE=single` for the log side of the trace (the spec's drill uses it); skip it, and say so in the ledger, when it does not.

- [ ] **Step 2: (a) A registration reaches `identity.events` with its trace**

```bash
curl -s -H 'traceparent: 00-4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736-00f067aa0ba902b7-01' -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"username":"drill-one","first_name":"Drill","email":"drill-one@example.com","password":"Drill-Passw0rd-1"}' \
  localhost:8085/api/v1/curtz/auth/register
docker compose --profile kafka-single exec kafka-single /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh \
  --bootstrap-server kafka-1:9092 --topic identity.events --from-beginning --timeout-ms 5000 \
  --property print.key=true --property print.headers=true 2>/dev/null | grep drill-one
make infra.psql MODE=single   # then: SELECT id, sent_time, attempts, parked_at FROM outbox_events ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 3;
```

Expected: the registration answers 2xx; exactly one record with the user's ID as key, headers `event_id`, `event_type=user.registered`, `aggregate_id`, `occurred_at` and a `traceparent` whose trace ID is `4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736` (the publish span is a child in that trace); the row has a `sent_time`. In Grafana (<http://localhost:3000>), Explore, Tempo, trace ID `4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736`: the HTTP span, the `identity.Register` span, the Postgres spans and a `identity.events publish` span of `curtz-worker`. If `docker compose exec` cannot find the service by that name, `docker compose --profile '*' ps` shows the name to use; correct the command in Task 15's section too.

- [ ] **Step 3: Confirm the Prometheus names of the relay metrics**

```bash
curl -s 'localhost:9090/api/v1/label/__name__/values' | python3 -c "import json,sys;print('\n'.join(n for n in json.load(sys.stdin)['data'] if n.startswith('outbox')))"
```

Expected: `outbox_relay_published_total`, `outbox_relay_backlog`, `outbox_relay_oldest_unsent_age_seconds`, `outbox_relay_parked_rows`, `outbox_relay_leader` and `outbox_relay_publish_duration_seconds_bucket`/`_count`/`_sum` (`outbox_relay_failures_total` appears after the first failure, in step 4). The metric export interval is 15 s, so wait a little after step 2. If any name differs from the one the alert rules, the dashboard JSON and Task 15's text use, correct all three together (rules and dashboard first, the rules' unit tests in `stack_test.yml` use the same names), re-run Task 14's promtool commands, and commit `fix(observability): use the metric names the stack really exposes`. Check the dashboard "Curtz worker" renders data in all nine panels.

- [ ] **Step 4: (b) Kafka stopped and started again**

```bash
docker compose --profile kafka-single stop kafka-single
for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code} ' -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d "{\"username\":\"drill-out-$i\",\"first_name\":\"Drill\",\"email\":\"drill-out-$i@example.com\",\"password\":\"Drill-Passw0rd-1\"}" \
  localhost:8085/api/v1/curtz/auth/register; done; echo
curl -s localhost:8086/health; echo; curl -s localhost:8086/health/ready; echo
```

Expected: five 2xx (the API does not need Kafka); the worker's `/health` stays 200 and `/health/ready` is 503 with `kafka` down; the worker container stays up and is not restarted (`docker compose --profile worker-single ps`); the five rows have no `sent_time` and `attempts = 0`, `parked_at` null (outage never counts). Then:

```bash
docker compose --profile kafka-single start kafka-single
sleep 40
docker compose --profile kafka-single exec kafka-single /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh \
  --bootstrap-server kafka-1:9092 --topic identity.events --from-beginning --timeout-ms 8000 \
  --property print.key=true 2>/dev/null | grep -c drill-out
curl -s 'localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=max(outbox_relay_backlog)' | python3 -m json.tool | grep -A1 '"value"'
```

Expected: `5` records (one per registration, in registration order: check the order of the `drill-out-N` users in the output), the backlog gauge back to 0, and every row sent. While Kafka was down the expression `max(outbox_relay_oldest_unsent_age_seconds{service_name="curtz-worker"})` was above zero in Prometheus (the alert itself needs five minutes above 300 seconds: evaluating the expression is enough here).

- [ ] **Step 5: (c) The worker killed in the middle of a batch**

Insert a few thousand rows and kill the worker while it publishes them:

```bash
make infra.psql MODE=single
```

```sql
WITH ids AS (SELECT gen_random_uuid() AS id, g FROM generate_series(1, 5000) g)
INSERT INTO outbox_events (id, partition_key, destination, event_type, headers, payload)
SELECT id, 'drill-' || (g % 10), 'identity.events', 'drill.event', json_build_object('event_id', id::text), json_build_object('n', g) FROM ids;
```

Then, from another terminal, straight away:

```bash
docker kill curtz-worker-single-1 && docker compose --profile worker-single up -d worker-single
sleep 30
make infra.psql MODE=single   # SELECT count(*) FILTER (WHERE sent_time IS NULL) AS unsent, count(*) AS total FROM outbox_events WHERE event_type = 'drill.event';
docker compose --profile kafka-single exec kafka-single /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh \
  --bootstrap-server kafka-1:9092 --topic identity.events --from-beginning --timeout-ms 15000 \
  --property print.headers=true 2>/dev/null | grep drill.event | grep -o 'event_id:[0-9a-f-]*' | sort | uniq -c | awk '{c[$1]++} END {for (k in c) print k" time(s): "c[k]" events"}'
```

(If the container name differs, `docker compose --profile worker-single ps --format '{{.Name}}'` shows it.) Expected: `unsent = 0` and `total = 5000`; the last command prints `1 time(s): <N> events` and, only if the kill came mid-batch, `2 time(s): <M> events` with `N + M = 5000` and nothing at 0: every event is delivered at least once, a duplicate repeats its `event_id`. If the kill landed before the first claim or after the last mark (nothing duplicated), repeat with a larger batch; the point is that no event is missing.

- [ ] **Step 6: (d) Two workers: one publishes, the other takes over**

Run a second worker on the host (single mode defaults reach `localhost:19092` and `localhost:5432`):

```bash
WORKER_HTTP_PORT=8087 go run ./app/cmd/worker
```

(a terminal of its own). Expected: it stays quiet and `curl -s localhost:8087/health/ready` answers 200; in Postgres `SELECT count(*) FROM pg_locks WHERE locktype = 'advisory' AND granted;` is `1` (only the container holds the lock) and `curl -s 'localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=sum(outbox_relay_leader)'` is 1. Now:

```bash
make infra.worker.down
sleep 12
```

then register a user or insert a drill row as in step 5 (one row is enough). Expected: the host worker's log shows it acquired the lease, the row is sent and appears on the topic, and `sum(outbox_relay_leader)` is 1 again. Stop the host worker with Ctrl-C (it exits 0, logging `shutting down the worker`) and start the container again: `make infra.worker.up MODE=single`.

- [ ] **Step 7: (e) A poison event is parked and the rest still flow**

```sql
INSERT INTO outbox_events (id, partition_key, destination, event_type, headers, payload)
VALUES (gen_random_uuid(), 'drill-poison', 'identity.events', 'drill.poison', '{}'::json, json_build_object('big', repeat('x', 2000000)));
```

then register a user (any), wait 10 seconds and look:

```sql
SELECT event_type, attempts, parked_at IS NOT NULL AS parked, left(error_message, 80) FROM outbox_events WHERE event_type IN ('drill.poison', 'user.registered') ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 3;
```

Expected: the poison row has `attempts = 3`, `parked = t` and an error message naming the oversized record; the registration after it is sent. `curl -s 'localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=outbox_relay_parked_rows'` shows 1 (and `OutboxEventsParked` would fire after five minutes: the expression is enough). Re-queue it:

```sql
UPDATE outbox_events SET parked_at = NULL, attempts = 0, error_message = NULL WHERE event_type = 'drill.poison';
```

Expected: within a few seconds it is parked again with `attempts = 3` (it is still too big), which shows both that the re-queue is picked up and that it does not wedge the relay.

- [ ] **Step 8: (f) The purge deletes only old sent rows**

```sql
UPDATE outbox_events SET sent_time = now() - interval '10 days' WHERE event_type = 'drill.event' AND sent_time IS NOT NULL;
SELECT count(*) FROM outbox_events WHERE event_type = 'drill.event';   -- 5000
```

Restart the worker (the active worker purges when it starts): `docker compose --profile worker-single restart worker-single`, wait 15 seconds, then run the `SELECT count(*)` again.

Expected: `0` left of the backdated drill rows; the worker's log has `outbox relay: purged sent events` with `"deleted":5000`; the parked poison row, the unsent rows (none now) and the recent registrations are all still there.

- [ ] **Step 9: (g) SIGTERM exits 0 and flushes**

```bash
docker compose --profile worker-single stop worker-single
docker compose --profile worker-single ps -a --format '{{.Name}} {{.Status}}'
docker compose --profile worker-single logs --tail 8 worker-single
```

Expected: the container exited with code 0 well within 25 seconds (`Exited (0)`), and the log's last lines are `shutting down the worker` and no error. In Grafana the worker's last spans are present. Start it again with `make infra.worker.up MODE=single`.

- [ ] **Step 10: Clean up the drill rows and, optionally, check HA**

```sql
DELETE FROM outbox_events WHERE event_type IN ('drill.event', 'drill.poison');
```

(the registrations made by the drill are ordinary users; leave them, or remove them through `make infra.psql` with `DELETE FROM users WHERE username LIKE 'drill-%';` after `DELETE FROM outbox_events WHERE partition_key IN (SELECT id::text FROM users WHERE username LIKE 'drill-%');`.)

Optional, only if `docker stats --no-stream` and the machine's memory allow it (HA runs Patroni behind HAProxy and three brokers): `make infra.worker.down`, `make infra.worker.up MODE=ha`, register a user through `make infra.app.up MODE=ha`, and confirm the record arrives and `/health/ready` reports both dependencies up: that the advisory lock works through HAProxy and the producer sees all brokers. Say in the ledger whether this was done or skipped for memory. Then return to the single stacks or stop what the drill started (`make infra.worker.down`, `make infra.app.down`), and leave the developer's own containers as they were.

- [ ] **Step 11: Fix what the drill found**

Anything that did not behave as expected is a defect in an earlier task or a wrong line in this plan: write the failing test first (unit, adapter or integration, in the owning task's file), fix it, run the whole suite, and commit as `fix(outbox): ...` with the trailer. Record each finding in the ledger as `Task 16: found <what> — fixed in <file>, test <name> RED→GREEN`, or as a `Ruling:` when the spec or the plan was wrong.

- [ ] **Step 12: Final checks**

Run each and read the output:

```bash
go build ./... && go vet ./app/... && go vet -tags integration ./app/...
gofmt -l app/cmd app/api/probes app/config/worker.go app/config/worker_test.go app/internal app/pkg/infra/queue app/pkg/infra/telemetry app/test
go test -count=1 ./... 2>&1 | tail -30
go test -race -count=1 ./app/internal/application/outbox ./app/internal/adapters/kafka ./app/pkg/infra/queue/kafka ./app/pkg/infra/telemetry ./app/api/probes ./app/cmd/worker ./app/config
~/go/bin/golangci-lint-v2 run ./app/... 2>&1 | tail -15
bash scripts/infra_test.sh 2>&1 | tail -2
make infra.config 2>&1 | tail -2
make lint.docker 2>&1 | tail -2
git status --short
```

Expected: build and both vets clean; no gofmt output (the old files named in the plan notes are not listed); every package `ok`; the race run `ok`; golangci-lint reports only the two findings that already exist in `sequence_short_code_gen.go`; `all tests passed`; `ok: all profiles`; `Done linting Dockerfile`; `git status` empty. `make lint.workflows` needs the `rhysd/actionlint:1.7.12` image: run it only if `docker images` shows it locally, otherwise say it was not run (no workflow file changed). Then the integration suites, which need Docker:

```bash
go test -tags integration -count=1 -timeout 30m ./app/pkg/infra/queue/kafka ./app/internal/adapters/postgres/... ./app/internal/application/outbox ./app/cmd/worker ./app/pkg/infra/database/postgres 2>&1 | tail -15
```

Expected: every package `ok`.

- [ ] **Step 13: Final whole-branch review**

Per the executing-plans skill: build the review package (`review-package PLAN MERGE_BASE HEAD`, with `MERGE_BASE=$(git merge-base feat/local-infra-stack HEAD)`: this branch forks from slices 1 to 4, not from `main`), dispatch the reviewer on the most capable model with this plan's Review Focus verbatim and the ledger's `Ruling:` lines, and handle its findings by the skill's rules (one fix pass, test first; minors to the ledger and the final message). Then finish with the finishing-a-development-branch skill.
