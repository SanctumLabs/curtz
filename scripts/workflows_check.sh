# Guards the CI rules this repository relies on (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-04-dockerfile-hardening-design.md):
#  1. every action is pinned to an exact version (v1.2.3, 14.0.6, 1.5) or a full commit SHA, never a branch, "latest" or a floating
#     major such as v4 (local actions and reusable workflows from SanctumLabs/ci-workflows are exempt);
#  2. every workflow declares top-level permissions;
#  3. in a workflow_run workflow every checkout names the triggering commit or branch (the default is the default branch);
#  4. Dependabot keeps the gomod, docker and github-actions pins current;
#  5. a workflow_run workflow checks workflow_run.conclusion, so it does not run when the workflow it follows failed.
